# Tyria

Tyria is the northernmost known continent of the world with the same name. It is the home of the former city of the Gods and the Tomb of the Primeval Kings. Tyria is home to many races, most noticeably the humans, Charr, Dwarves, Norn, and recently, the Asura.

Tyria and the surrounding islands are divided into several major regions 

**Regions in Guild Wars Prophecies**

·        The Ruins of Ascalon: The remains of a once great kingdom lie in ruins here in the eastern area of the continent. This region is under perpetual military occupation by Charr warbands who have laid siege to its few remaining bastions of human civilization.

·        The Crystal Desert: Formerly a sea dotted with cays, small islands, and sandy beaches, it has since been transformed into a barren desert. The dying elder Forgotten race stand ever vigilant in fulfilling their sacred duties. Found in the northwestern region of the continent Elona, it is sandwiched between the Blazeridge Mountains, peninsula of Orr, and the Desolation.

·        The Krytan Kingdom: A lush and green area rich with fertile volcanic soil. Found in the central-western area of the continent, the kingdom and its people are currently the only human-settlement to prosper where all others have perished. Despite this, its countryside are besieged by an Undead plague; its people divided by whispers of civil war. Ascalonian refugees pouring in from the east have taken refuge here; while theocratic White Mantle paramilitaries continue to preach of their new gods.

·        The Maguuma Jungle: A dense jungle found in the western area of the continent. Centaurs roam its untamed wilds and timeless Druid spirits tends the prehistoric plant-life and coexist with all manner of dire-beasts; while Shining Blade insurgents take refuge within its labyrinth of old growths and devise ways to strike from its shadows.

·        The Ring of Fire Islands: An island chain found past the southwestern shores of the continent, and west of the peninsula of Orr. It was here that the Gods of Tyria plunged the giant bloodstones into the caldera of its largest volcano, Abaddon's Mouth.

·        The Shiverpeak Mountains: A giant mountain chain that acts as a divider running north to south, between Ascalon and Kryta, and connects to the Far Shiverpeaks. The Shiverpeak Mountains have three sub-regions, two being accessible in Prophecies: the Northern Shiverpeaks and the Southern Shiverpeaks. Both regions are in a warring state between the Stone Summit and Deldrimor Dwarves.

**Regions in Guild Wars Eye of the North**

·        The Charr Homelands: A deciduous verdant region in the northeastern part of the continent. Northern half of Ascalon region claimed by the Charr, rumors of unrest and civil strife have traveled beyond its borders.

·        The Depths of Tyria: Vast underground lakes, crystallized superstructures, superheated magma chambers, and near endless labyrinth of tunnels drilled though solid bedrock; all sporadically connect by an advance gateway network created by the Asura. 

·        The Far Shiverpeaks: The northernmost sub-region of the Shiverpeak Mountain chain that acts as a divider running north to south, between Charr Homelands and Woodland Cascades, and connects to the Northern Shiverpeaks. It is the homeland of the Norn.

·        The Tarnished Coast: A tropical rainforest sub-region of the southern Maguuma Jungle, it is littered with abandoned ruins that are being renovated by the Asura, having been driven from the Depths of Tyria.

·        The Woodland Cascades: A forested area that lies north of Kryta and west of the Far Shiverpeaks, and includes the Verdant Cascades.

·        Unnamed regions: 

o   Around Sparkfly Swamp: A moderately swampy area along the edge of Shiverpeaks Mountains and the Sea of Sorrows' coast.

**Known inaccessible regions**

·        The Blazeridge Mountains: A mountain chain that runs east of the nation of Ascalon and heads south towards the barren Crystal Desert.

·        Orr: The remnants of the peninsula of Orr. Arah, the holy city and capital of this once great kingdom, has been swallowed by the Sea of Sorrows during a cataclysmic event. Corsair sailors take refuge among the ruins along with what remains of the restless undead Orrians who haunt this once great nation.

·        Janthir: A desolate looking island in the sea north of Kryta.

**Major bodies of water**

·        The Giant's Basin: A combination of two large salt lakes on the northern edge of Kryta. The town of Demetra resides between them.

·        The Janthir Bay: A sea to the far north of the Maguuma Jungle and west of the Far Shiverpeaks. Little is known about this body of water, other than the Isles of Janthir that resides within it.

·        The Sea of Sorrows: The bay that lies south of Kryta, formerly called the Bay of Sirens until Orr fell.

·        The Strait of Malchor: The body of water that resides between the fallen kingdom of Orr and the Ring of Fire Island Chain.

# Ascalon

*“Once, Ascalon was a beautiful, fertile land of rolling green countryside and magnificent cities. Her people were viewed as grim by their neighbors. This was perhaps, to be expected, given their never-ending war against the aggressive Charr. Indeed, it was their unfailing vigilance, their Great Northern Wall, and the blood they shed each year to defend it that had protected not only Ascalon, but also Kryta and Orr through the ages.* 

*Then came the invasion, and with it, the Searing.* 

*Anyone alive today will remember the day the lands of Ascalon were blasted and torn with magic fire. Whole cities and guilds were destroyed in the Searing, and the might of Ascalon was shattered. Now the Great Northern Wall lies broken, and the Charr have overrun much of the kingdom, defiling it with their unholy shrines, killing those who stand in their way.* 

*The survival of Ascalon hinges on but a single remaining corner of the fallen kingdom—the capital city of Rin. In the final years of the last Guild War, the people of Rin looked to a soldier named Adelbern, a simple man of humble origins, who rallied the people with his courage and cunning and steeled them not only against the guilds of Orr and Kryta but also against the terrors of the Charr.* 

*The sudden destruction of most of the kingdom during the Searing has taken much of the fight out of the man now known as King Adelbern. He has become stubborn and set in his ways, afraid of losing what little he has left. But in his son Rurik, the people see a leader with the courage to perhaps help them reclaim their fallen kingdom.* 

*The survivors of Ascalon live in a state of constant warfare, using hit-and-run tactics and the remnants of the Great Wall to prevent any significant advances by the Charr into their territory. King Adelbern has circled the wagons, so to speak, content to simply defend what Ascalon has left and live to fight another day. Prince Rurik, on the other hand, is far more daring than his father thinks is wise, and has even suggested that the time may be coming to launch an offensive against the Charr.* 

*Already the rumbling of the winds of change can be heard in the streets. People are frightened. They wonder what will become of them. Some even wonder aloud if Adelbern has lost what it takes to steer Ascalon back from the brink. They wish to see the prince step up and take command of the kingdom. Perhaps under his guidance, the people of Ascalon will live on to see another golden age.”*

Ascalon is a beleaguered human nation in Tyria. Ascalon lies between the large Shiverpeak Mountains to the west and the Blazeridge Mountains to the east. Humans conquered a large portion of the land and established Ascalon in 100 BE and holds King's Watch, where King Doric was crowned. There has been a constant war with the Charr since that time, which had been in Ascalon's favor due to the Charr's disorganization until the Searing. With the Searing, the Charr gained the upper hand and even managed to get multiple warbands through Ascalon to head towards Orr. Since then, the battle with the Charr became a true struggle. 

Until the Charr invasion, Ascalon borders and structures reached as far north as the edge of the now-scorched lands. The northernmost known settlement being Duke Gaban's estate, which was one of the first lands to be struck during the Charr invasion. Sometime in the past, Ascalonians also headed south into the Crystal Desert and the Desolation, sending expeditions and building at least one structure, which is located in the Shattered Ravines. 

The people of Ascalon are known as Ascalonians.

*“The mighty kingdom of Ascalon has seen better days. Humbled under the relentless assault of the Charr, its cities ruined, its population scattered across the globe—Ascalon has become a conquered and savaged nation. Brave heroes have slowed, but not stemmed, the invading hordes. A large military force under the command of King Adelbern continues to defend the nation from incursion, but they slip farther and farther south as their battle lines collapse beneath the strength of the Charr forces.* 

*In these dire times, brave cadres of Ascalonians—among them, the Ebon Vanguard—have taken up the fight to save Ascalon from the Charr and free it once more. These small units—many made up of humans who have escaped Charr enslavement—have slipped behind (and, in some cases, broken through) the Charr lines. They harry the invaders and divert supplies and troops away from Ascalon, leaving the Charr to gnash their teeth at human ingenuity and perseverance.”*

*“Blasted and battered, the current landscape of Ascalon holds only the ghost of its former glory. Skeletons of grand cathedrals and remnants of whole cities lie broken on the shifted, displaced ground. The protective Great Northern Wall is perhaps the most intact structure in the entire kingdom, but the destruction that surrounds it lies in testament to its ultimate failure.* 

*Before the Charr invasion and the Searing, Ascalon was a fertile land, full of wheat fields and blossoming flowers. Now though, little grows here in this wasteland. The once loamy earth is now dry and arid. The riverbeds have dried up, and the mudflats have turned into a patchwork of cracked plates and jagged scars in the ground.”*

## Ascalon Foothills

The Ascalon Foothills slopes up to the west to meet the cold sides of the Shiverpeaks. It is a small area populated by elementals and hydra, one of the most dangerous foes in the Ascalon region to the ill-prepared.

## Diessa Lowlands

The Diessa Lowlands, like the rest of Ascalon, is a scorched and barren piece of land. It is also dotted with the ruins of Ascalonian cities that have fallen to the charr invasion. It is now an inhospitable region patrolled by Charr and home to gargoyles, elementals, and devourers.

\-         There may be a hidden Flame Temple

### Grendich Courthouse

*“The one-time seat of judicial power in Grendich village, the formerly grand courthouse is now in shambles.”*

Grendich Courthouse stands in the Diessa Lowlands, and is a popular stop on runs from Ascalon City or Piken Square to Yak's Bend.

## Dragon’s Gullet

Dragon's Gullet is a remote cul-de-sac in the far north of Ascalon. It is a wasteland of tar pits, rugged hills, and scattered ruins. The Charr can be found here, but given the extreme inhospitality of this area, they are few in number. This sparsely populated area is home to wildlife that have managed to adapt to the hostile environment. This is the most dangerous area in the Ascalon region.

## Drascir

Drascir was the capital of Ascalon until it fell in the hands of the Charr. It was then replaced by Rin which later fell in turn.

## Eastern Frontier

Ascalon's Eastern Frontier was once a lush green land of rolling hills. Now, as with the rest of Ascalon, it is a blasted piece of barren land littered with ruins. Large sections of the once great wall lie broken and breached in several places as the Charr make their presence felt, establishing a foothold in the northeast. Aside from the Charr, the Grawl appear to have flourished as well, having a heavy presence to the northwest. Further south, the broken land has become a haven for Devourers waiting to ambush unsuspecting prey.

### Ruins of Surmia

*“Just outside of the the Great Northern Wall lie the ruins of a once great city. This was Surmia, one of the kingdom of Ascalon's cultural and economic centers. Built in a time of great optimism, the founders laughed at any who criticized the wisdom of placing a city outside the protection of the Wall.”*

Surmia, founded during the Season of the Phoenix of 1020 AE, was once one of the most prosperous cities in the Kingdom of Ascalon, along with Ascalon City, Nolani Academy, Drascir, and Rin. The city of Surmia was established as a monument honoring those who died during the second Guild War. It was built outside the Great Northern Wall as part of honoring the fallen, recognizing their brave deeds and performing a brave deed of their own, and was one of the first cities to fall to the Charr invasion and the Searing.

## Flame Temple Corridor

The Flame Temple Corridor refers to a small blasted area in the northern part of Charr-held Ascalon. Most of it is a desolate set of gullies winding between surrounding hills. The Charr appeared to have converted the ruins' entirety into a makeshift temple, in which they perform ritual sacrifice at an altar. While Charr presence is strong in and around the temple complex, the occasional Hydra groups can be found prowling the edges.

### Flame Temple

The Flame Temples are sacred structures to the Charr. Each temple contains raised platforms with inscribed circular runes which define and magically feed sacred fires. Around the ring are pillars of obsidian or sandstone, sculpted to depict the Charr's gods. The Sacred Flames are kept lit at these locations as a sign of respect to their gods. 

Every once in a while, they bring a fresh brazier of fire to it. The temple is guarded by four Flame Keepers with the job to keep the Sacred Flame burning.

## Frontier Gate

*“One of the few working gates left in the Great Northern Wall, Frontier Gate marks the border between the remaining survivors of Ascalon and the lands to the north, now occupied by the Charr. Few venture past this point, and those who do rarely return to tell of their travels.”*

Frontier Gate is an outpost in the Great Northern Wall, and stands between the ruined wastelands of Ascalon to the south and the Charr-infested lands to the north.

## Great Northern Wall

The Great Northern Wall, referred to as Northern Wall, the Great Wall, and the Wall for short, began construction in 898 AE; it stretches from the Shiverpeak Mountains in the west, to the Eastern Frontier. It was built before the start of the latest Guild Wars, when the Charr threat began to appear imminent once again. The Wall was erected to protect the bulk of the Ascalon kingdom. However, over time the Ascalonians began expanding north beyond the Wall, establishing cities not protected by the Wall, including Surmia, Nolani, and Drascir, which became the capital until it fell during the Charr invasion. 

The Wall appears to hold three distinct designs in its architecture, with a thicker design in the west and a thinner one to the east. A doubled section of the Wall can be seen just southwest of Piken Square within the Breach. Within the Great Northern Wall's center lies Ascalon's largest city and cultural center, Ascalon City. 

During the Searing, the Wall was severely damaged and broken, allowing the Charr armies to invade all of Ascalon.

### Hammer Gate

The Hammer Gate is one of few gates in Old Ascalon that leads across the Great Northern Wall. Gate guard Hollis and a number of gate guards protect this area. 

After the Searing, it is the only viable way north of the Wall except through missions and within the Eastern Frontier.

### The Great Northern Wall (outpost)

*“The Great Northern Wall is the last line of defense between the beastlike Charr of the north, and the last two remaining cities of the fallen kingdom of Ascalon. Before the Searing, the Northern Gate was the grand, diplomatic entrance used to greet visiting dignitaries. Now it is just another outpost, manned by the Ascalon army and citizens who volunteer for guard duty.”*

## Nolani

Nolani was once one of the famous cities of the Kingdom of Ascalon, and home to the now-ruined Nolani Academy, situated to the city's south. 

Within the center of the city lies the Historical Monument of Nolani, dedicated to Ascalon's Chosen.

### Nolani Academy

*“None of Ascalon's academies of magic remain intact after the Searing. In its prime, the academy in Nolani was known all across Tyria as one of the most prestigious schools of magic on the entire continent. Ambassadors from Orr and Kryta often made special arrangements to have their children study here, even though they were not of Ascalon descent.”*

Nolani Academy of the Arcane Arts is a mission outpost. It was one of the most advanced schools in Ascalon. It had a sister academy in Drascir, with a portal in each academy linking the two together. The academy lies on the edge of the town of Nolani and has multiple obelisks for defense, though like much of Ascalon it hasn't seen use since the Searing.

### Nolani Academy Graveyard

Nolani Academy's graveyard is an unnamed graveyard that resides between Nolani and Rin, along the northern side of the Great Northern Wall. Deep within the graveyard lies a Tome Pedestal where the Tome of the Fallen is kept. The graveyard is where those who fell on the Wall were buried, and their restless spirits haunt the place. 

Watchman Pramas was ordered to take the Tome of the Fallen, but realized it was cursed making the spirits of those buried become more active and hostile until the book's return.

## Old Ascalon

Before the Searing, Old Ascalon was a beautiful, pastoral land of rolling hills and farms. Now nothing remains but a barren, blasted wasteland infested with monsters.

### Ascalon City

*“The largest city and cultural center of the now-ruined empire. Ascalon City is one of the only two remaining in the entire kingdom. Though the buildings have fallen and the cathedrals are shambles, the people here live on in the shadow of what once was.”*

#### Ascalon Arena

*“For hundreds of years, heroes of all stripes have been coming to the Arenas in times of peace to practice and hone their skills. The Ascalon Arena is one of the best places for new heroes to train and learn the basics of arena combat.”*

### Sardelac Sanitarium

*“Once an abbey dedicated to Dwayna, Sardelac Sanitarium is now used to house those who have suffered serious mental harm during the Searing.”*

Sardelac Sanitarium, once known as Ashford Abbey, houses several individuals suffering from the Searing. Most of the trainers from before the Searing have taken residence here to aid the those suffering. The area once held access to the Ascalon Catacombs, but the entrance collapsed due to the Searing.

## Pockmark Flats

The Pockmark Flats is the name of the large area to the southeast of Ascalon City. In the northern half of the area, shards of what is possibly the largest crystal to have crashed into Ascalon during the Searing lay embedded in the blasted earth, surrounded by a moat of tar. Judging from the scant ruins in the blasted area, a sizable Ascalon community must have been wiped out in an instant. Further testament to the destruction wrought on that fateful day is an extensive stretch of ruins and broken architecture in the southern half of the Flats, with a series of uneven trails winding through the tragic landscape.

### Pockmark Crystal

The dominating landmark "Pockmark crystal" is an exceedingly large Searing crystal. It resides in the center of a large crater, the lowest portion being full of tar, within northern Pockmark Flats. The tar it lies within is surrounded by three Earth Altars, used for summoning a Stone Golem.

### Serenity Temple

*“Once the largest in Ascalon, Serenity Temple was the only holy site in Ascalon dedicated to all five Tyrian gods: Dwayna, Balthazar, Grenth, Melandru, and Lyssa. Destroyed in the Searing, the priests and priestesses of the temple try their best to carry on, though the temple is now nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding rubble.”*

Serenity Temple is an outpost located in the middle of the Pockmark Flats. It was once a beautiful place, but it was reduced to rubble during the Searing.

## Regent Valley

Once a beautiful place, Regent Valley was reduced to a barren wasteland during the Searing, its land stripped bare and its rivers befouled. While it was never truly a safe place, Regent Valley is now overrun by monsters and highwaymen, and of course the Charr. King's Watch stands in the middle of Regent Valley, between Fort Ranik and Sardelac Sanitarium.

### Fort Ranik

*“Fort Ranik was the facility used by the Ascalon military to train new soldiers to fight in the Guild Wars. When the wars ended, the fort itself, like most other buildings in Ascalon, had been almost completely destroyed. All that remains are the outer walls and the memories of what once was.”*

Fort Ranik is a mission outpost and was once located within a forested area, but has since fell due to the Searing. After the second Charr invasion by Bonfaaz Burntfur, Fort Ranik became the staging area for a counter assault.

### King’s Watch

King's Watch is an important place in Regent Valley between Fort Ranik and Sardelac Sanitarium. It was founded on the 95th day of 1 AE, early in the Season of the Phoenix, at the site where King Doric was crowned over a century earlier. Ever since, it has been where every king of Ascalon, up to and including King Adelbern, was crowned.

### Moa Nests

Moa Nests are found in the southeastern corner of Regent Valley along with a congregation of Moa Birds.

## Rin

Rin is the capital of the Kingdom of Ascalon. It is located south of the Nolani Academy and along the south side of the Great Northern Wall. Rin became the capital of Ascalon when Drascir fell into the hands of the Charr. 

Since the Searing, Rin, like the rest of Ascalon, lies in ruins and is one of the last two cities in Ascalon, the other being the largest city, Ascalon City. King Adelbern still holds his throne in Rin and organizes the war against the Charr from there. 

During the Charr invasion, Rin fell to the Charr forces that were lead by Bonfaaz Burntfur and is seen at the brink of falling into their hands during the Nolani Academy mission. With the use of Stormcaller and the storm that it summoned, Rin was saved by Prince Rurik and the Charr's fires were extinguished and their forces weakened. 

During their attack, the Charr stole various relics from Rin, which can be recovered in the Cathedral of Flames in the Charr Homelands.

\-         The Ascalon Athenaeum was located here.

\-         Rin is the birthplace of Devona

### Horn Hill

The Horn Hill is a hill just north of the city of Rin and south of Nolani Academy in Ascalon. The legendary horn of King Doric, Stormcaller, is built upon it and it faces the city of Rin.

## The Breach

The Breach is the simple name given to the area north where the Charr broke through the wall and invaded into the rest of Ascalon. Most of the once-green terrain has been scorched dry and the rivers tainted with tar.

### Piken Square

Piken Square prior to the Searing was an abandoned area located in The Northlands, west of the Charr performing the Ritual of the Searing. Why it was abandoned is unknown, given how there are still human settlements north of the Great Northern Wall during this time. It contains a graveyard within it, where ancient fighters of Ascalon were buried.

*“In years past, Piken Square was a bustling market where farmers and merchants would come to hawk their wares. Its ruined stalls are all that remain.”*

## The Gaban Estate

The Gaban estate is the former estate of Duke Gaban. It resides on the northern edge of Ascalon, and was barely missed by the scorching aspects of the Searing. Due to its far placement to the north, it was one of the first places assaulted by the Charr and its ruins were converted into an arena. It is connected to a series of catacombs which is said that no one, except for Gwen, escaped from.

--------------

# Blazeridge Mountains

The Blazeridge Mountains is the mountain range east of Ascalon that curves down from north of Drascir to where it merges with the Southern Shiverpeaks north of the Crystal Desert. As such, it acts as a natural boundary between Ascalon and the Crystal Desert as well as the charr controlled lands to the east. The currently abandoned mining village of Ebonhawke resides where the mountain range merges with the Shiverpeak Mountains. 

Currently, ogres reside in the Blazeridge Mountains.

--------------------

# Charr Homelands

The Charr Homelands lie to the north of Ascalon and, as the name implies, is the current homeland of the Charr. Its geography is much like how Ascalon was before the Searing and is home to Grawl, Skale, Worms, and a variety of Devourers among other creatures. Its true name is unknown. 

The Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik can be seen sleeping in the center of this region, between the three explorable areas.

## Dalada Uplands

Dalada Uplands is an area in the Charr Homelands in Eye of the North. Mantids live in the forests, but Charr exist just about everywhere else in the zone. The Charr base, Doomlore Shrine is found in the northwest corner of the zone. A Siege Devourer lies in the northern reaches of the plains, just south of Doomlore, but beware of the powerful Molotov Rocktail nearby.

### Cathedral of Flames

*Once freed, Pyre's warband sacked the cathedral, looking for anything of value. In their search, they unearthed a blocked passage. Clearing the debris revealed a stash of treasure plundered from Ascalonian ruins... but there was more. The spirits of those slain for these spoils of war had attached themselves to the treasure, haunting the vaults. Worse yet, a powerful Necromancer named Murakai dwelt among them. She used the creatures' unliving essence to create a storm of souls, which she planned to unleash upon human and Charr alike. It fell to us to lay these disembodied spirits to rest and to suspend Murakai's wrath, if only for a time.*

### Doomlore Shrine

*This dark shrine radiates heat and magic, a testament to ancient days of Charr domination and worship to their former gods, the Titans. Now, in the absence of these deities, the shrine has become a haven for the Charr Shaman caste. An entrance at the shrine leads to a sprawling complex beneath known as the Cathedral of Flames.*

### Kralkatorrik

Kralkatorrik, also referred to as the Elder Crystal Dragon, is one of the slumbering Elder Dragons. It rests half-buried in the Charr Homelands, located in the center of the lake that separates the Grothmar Wardowns from the Dalada Uplands. Sediment build up has formed an island around the dormant creature. 

The dragon went dormant in pre-historic era preceding the gods' arrival. Whether the lake formed after it went to sleep, was already present when it did so, or was formed by the dragon itself is unknown.

## Grothmar Wardowns

Grothmar Wardowns is an area of open wilderness on the lower slopes of the Far Shiverpeaks with a densly forested central part. In the east it borders on the lake which the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik, which appears as an island, rests in, and on the shores of the lake the Charr have built a fortified camp.

### Charr Camp

This fortified Charr camp lies on the eastern edge of Grothmar Wardowns, next to the lake that resides in the middle of the Charr Homelands. It consists of earthen walls surrounding a collection of buildings and cells. Two wooden watchtowers guard the approaches. The cells appear to be used for both prisoners and livestock, including Grawl.

### Ooze Pit

*The earthquakes allowed numerous creatures, some previously unknown to man, to rise from the depths. Disgusting membranous creatures of fluid and phlegm are one such anomaly to arrive. At a loss for words, most adventurers simply call them "oozes." These highly adaptable creatures mutate and thrive in all manner of environments, including the intense heat of molten earth. Their adaptability goes far beyond simple survival. Oozes get more than simple sustenance from feeding on their prey. They assume the magical abilities inherent in the creatures they ingest. There is no telling how many creatures... and humans... may linger in an ooze, giving it access to a huge variety of powers. As a result, elder oozes are far more dangerous than their young. As testament to the tenacity of the human race, some merchants specialize in trading for the jelly-like creatures. The oozes' applications in magic, medicine, and alchemy are far-reaching.*

## Polymock Crossing

Polymock Crossing is an area where Polymock matches take place. You are brought here when you challenge certain NPCs to a Polymock match.

## Sacnoth Valley

Sacnoth Valley is a wild and mountainous area in the Charr Homelands. The charr maintain a heavily fortified stronghold in the northwest (the location for Assault on the Stronghold mission). Large tribes of grawl dominate the northeast and southwest. Towards the southeastern corner one will find large a number of elementals, most notable amongst them are the fire elementals that created an inferno out of a forest in the southeast corner. 

There are two dungeon entrances in the area; Rragar's Menagerie to the southwest, and Catacombs of Kathandrax to the southeast.

### Burning Forest

The burning forest of the Charr Homelands is located in the south-eastern portion of Sacnoth Valley. It is believed to have been set on fire by the Titan Ignus the Eternal, and is where Charr Shamans attempted to begin a second Searing. It is filled with fire-based elementals, making it extremely dangerous.

### Catacombs of Kathandrax

*Remnants of the Ebon Vanguard survived in the Catacombs of Kathandrax. While on a mission to recover a legendary weapon, they were ambushed by overwhelming Charr forces. Captain Langmar made it clear to her troops: recovering Kathandrax's Crusher was of utmost importance. Broken and weary, the remaining Vanguard found little solace, for they found the caves infested with fire elementals and other terrible creatures. Their numbers few, they no longer had the strength to reach the artifact. Because its immense power would surely aid the Ebon Vanguard in the ongoing battle against the Charr, we had no choice but to help them retrieve it. Kathandrax's Crusher was hidden deep beneath the raging fires of Sacnoth Valley, protected by a fiery elemental lord.*

The Catacombs of Kathandrax is an ancient tomb for the Dwarven hero, Kathandrax Steelsoul. It is located in the southeast of Sacnoth Valley.

### Hierophant’s Stronghold

*Situated in Sacnoth Valley in the far southern domains of the Charr homelands, this heavily defended fortification serves as the forward base of Hierophant Burntsoul, a prominent leader among the Charr Shaman caste. Since the demise of the Titans, the Shamans seek new, more powerful patrons to serve as their deities in order cement [sic] control over the Charr legions.* 

*The stronghold dominates a narrow pass between two rock outcroppings and is protected by towers and siege devourers. The Charr excavated the surrounding outcroppings and use them as containment pens for prisoners and other, darker things.* 

*Hierophant Burntsoul is relenteless in his desire to hold onto his power and will go to any lengths necessary to guarantee success. He would choose to leave no survivors rather than let the Charr fall under any other leadership.*

The Hierophant's Stronghold is, as the name implies, the stronghold in which Hierophant Burntsoul resides. It is located in Sacnoth Valley and can only be accessed after the completion of Assault on the Stronghold. Within the center of the stronghold resides a pit for prisoners and a large cauldron that resembles the Cauldron of Cataclysm. 

It is one of last remaining bastions of the Shaman-ruled Charr society. It is also the site where Pyre Fierceshot sparked a revolution, upsetting the status quo which was maintained under the Shaman caste rule.

### Rragar’s Menagerie

*Greater dangers awaited deep within the earth, where a Charr named Rragar Maneater bred a race of murderous creatures. These creatures, known as fleshreavers, were horrible, voracious monsters with an unusual evolutionary method. Young fleshreavers, it seems, are born as barely more than tiny skeletons. To survive and evolve, the emaciated young rely on their parents to harvest muscle, organ, and fat from their prey, and then layer it over their skeletons of the newborns. Rragar had taken advantage of this disgusting, yet easily-manipulated evolution, to perform ghastly experiments on the fleshreavers, turning them into powerful weapons to be used against humanity. By searching carefully, we found unexpected allies among Rragar's failed creations. Rragar was still difficult to defeat, for he was armed with powerful magic and could teleport freely around his twisted workshop.*

----------------

# Crystal Desert

*Legends tell of a time, thousands of years ago, when the Crystal Desert was covered in water. These legends claim that it was the gods who raised the land, leaving it bare and empty in order to give the solitary creatures of the world a place to call their own. If the legends are true, humans were not among those for whom this land was made. There have been attempts by humans to settle in the desert, but they have, without exception, failed miserably, leaving behind only the grand monuments they built here proclaiming their short-lived triumph over this harsh land.* 

*The weather in the Crystal Desert is hot and unforgiving. The winds blow hard, making and unmaking dunes, covering up the present and uncovering the past. An examination of the sand will reveal that each grain is actually a tiny, pointed crystal. In isolated locations, larger crystal formations have been revealed by the constant, unforgiving wind.*

Formerly the Crystal Sea, the Crystal Desert was created shortly before the Exodus of the Gods in Year 0. It was formed alongside the Desolation, also formerly a part of the Crystal Sea, when the Five Gods defeated Abaddon. The Crystal Desert connects to the southern continent of Elona and had at one point been ruled by the Primeval Kings of the southern continent. In the past, there have been at least four groups of humans attempting to settle in the land: the Margonites, the Elonians, the Seekers, and Ascalonians. 

Despite mostly being arid and dry, the Crystal Desert has a few oases and deepened valleys holding vegetation. It is also riddled with giant statues of an ancient civilization, ruins of the failed Crystal Desert Elonian colony, and large natural cliffs. In the center of the Crystal Desert lies the Mesa, which houses structures seen elsewhere only in the Hall of Heroes. It is inhabited by a variety of insects, Riders, Drakes, Wurms, the Forgotten, Losaru Centaurs, Hydra, and the ghosts of those who died in the region.

## Diviner’s Ascent

Diviner's Ascent is the northeastern explorable area of the Crystal Desert.

### Elona Reach

*This desolated outpost overlooks the skeletal remains of what might once have been a bustling seaport. Brackish puddles are all that remain of the water that once meant life to fishermen and traders alike. Today, rotted pilings and tattered sailcloth are all that mark this ghost harbor.*

Elona Reach is a mission outpost. It is one of the three trials to open the path of Ascension. It is the home of one of the two now desolate Crystal Desert Elonian colony towns.

#### Vision Crystal

The Vision Crystal is an ancient artifact that everyone is required to obtain if they wish to ascend. The crystal focuses the gaze of the Gods of Tyria during the champions final Ascension test, facing the Doppelganger. 

Its individual parts were separated to keep it safe from harm, but each Elonian group entrusted with a piece began to mistrust the other Elonians, so the crystal was kept separate to keep one Elonian group from gaining the full power of the vision crystal. It is reunited by doing the mission Elona Reach.

## Prophet’s Path

Prophet's Path is the area of the Desert that is closest to the sea. A line of monoliths mark the namegiving path, leading from The Amnoon Oasis to Augury Rock.

### Amnoon Oasis

*For travelers into the desert, this tiny harbor represents a last chance to rest and resupply. It also provides one last view of water, sight of which becomes increasingly rare as one ventures eastward.*

The Amnoon Oasis is the town and port of the Crystal Desert.

### Heroes’ Audience

*The ruined statues in this isolated outpost are thought to be remnants of one of the many failed civilizations the Crystal Desert has claimed. When traders first crossed the desert and established themselves amidst these fallen gods, they told one another campfire stories of how these stone figures once lived and granted favors and magics to heroes lost in these harsh lands. Hence the name, Heroes' Audience.*

## Salt Flats

Salt Flats is littered with the ruins of the ancient seafaring civilization as well as the remains of ancient massive beasts, judging by the size of the bones.

### Seeker’s Passage

*Situated on the edge of the great Salt Flats, this tiny outpost is named for the Seekers, pilgrims said to have crossed the desert in search of a new home. The bones of some massive creature litters the area, a warning to the wise.*

## Skyward Reach

Skyward Reach is the center of the Crystal Desert. It is itself centered on the Mesa.

### Augury Rock

*Surrounded by mysterious pillars like stone guardians, this overlook is named for the immense crag that looms in the distance, beckoning any brave enough to approach. Do not be deceived: the rock guards its secrets well.*

Augury Rock is a mission outpost.

### Destiny’s Gorge

*Once thought to be a mere legend, Destiny's Gorge is a beautiful oasis in the midst of the deadly Crystal Desert. Adventurers lucky enough to make it to this outpost are treated to blue waters and lush foliage, as well as all the goods and services available at outposts throughout Tyria.*

Destiny's Gorge is one of the few outposts within the Crystal Desert. It is home to two of the secondary profession changers.

### The Mesa

The Mesa is a giant sacred rock directly east of Augury Rock with an oval shape and a flat top. Hidden inside this rock is the Hall of Ascension, where players get to fight their Doppelganger. This is the final test for Ascension. 

To gain access to the Mesa, players have to complete all 3 missions in the Crystal Desert, and then talk to Great Ritual Priest Zahmut in Augury Rock. You will be teleported to the entrance of the Mesa where you have to cleanse yourself with the Vision Crystal then step on the three Ascension runes on the ground to open the path to the Hall of Ascension.

The symbols of the three runes represent the three Ascension missions (Elona Reach, Thirsty River, and Dunes of Despair). They will light up when you step on them if you are enchanted by Divine Fire and you have completed the relevant mission.

#### Hall of Ascension

The Hall of Ascension is the hidden area within the Mesa and where the final test of Ascension, defeating the Doppleganger, takes place. It is accessed only by those who have gained the favor of the gods by completing the three trials of Ascension. 

The Hall of Ascension is made out of the same materials as the Hall of Heroes as well as holding some aspects seen in the Tomb of the Primeval Kings. It is the only place to hold golden statues of the Five Gods, and likewise is the only location with a golden statue of Grenth.

## the Arid Sea

The Arid Sea is the driest and most inhospitable part of the Crystal Desert, as evidenced by the sparse population of desert creatures. A long time ago, there used to be a thriving settlement here, before internal dispute brought it all to ruin. Now, nothing lies here save dust, ruins, and memories. 

Far to the south, a little known passage takes would-be explorers to the continent of Elona.

### Abandoned Village

An unnamed abandoned village lies in ruin in the northwestern corner of Arid Sea. It once belonged as part of the Crystal Desert Elonian colony, but was brought down due to internal dispute and the usage of an Ancient Weapon, killing all the inhabitants off. Now only the buildings' foundations remain and the town is inhabited by Enchanted armors.

### Lonely Vigil

*Statue of a warrior in the far northwest, facing unknown lands.*

The Lonely Vigil is a gigantic statue of a female Warrior located in the south west side of The Arid Sea. From a distance, the statue appears to be standing upright. When approached, the statue instantly breaks down, and only the boots remain upright. After this, the body serves as a bridge between two mesas and provides access to the Forgotten NPC Siliss Yassith. 

The statue can also be seen from the Crystal Overlook in Elona. Observed from a distance, the statue seems to be moving back and forth, as if it's about to fall over; however you never actually see it fall. One moment it's up, the next moment it's down, without any animation.

## The Scar

The Scar derives its name from the "scar" of greenery that runs through its center, fed by hidden wellsprings. The Losaru centaurs claim this fertile oasis as their own. Surrounding the gorges are rocky cliffs bearing sand dunes upon them, populated by the usual denizens of the desert.

### Thirsty River

*One look at this dry and desolated gorge tells the tale of its naming. Where once flowed a mighty river that shaped the land over millennia, now wind and sand make their way along deep channels, now little more than an echo of the past.*

Thirsty River is a mission outpost. It is one of the three trials to open the path of Ascension. Having once been a river, it is now riddled with buildings created out of the remains of wrecked Margonite ships.

## The Dragon’s Lair

*The great dragon prophet, Glint, is not easy to find, for she uses powerful magics to make her lair inside a single crystalline grain of sand. A person could search a hundred lifetimes and never find the exact grain. The only true entrance is through this portal, beyond the challenges of Augury Rock.*

The Dragon's Lair is a mission outpost. It is the home and sanctuary to Glint and her Forgotten.

### Tomb of the Primeval Kings

*Legends remain of noble spirits who stand watch over the tombs. If there is a passage between the mortal world and the Underworld, surely such spirits would know how to find it.*

The Tomb of the Primeval Kings is where ancient Elonian kings are buried, along with some famous heroes such as Lord Victo. This is where players form parties to fight against the forces of chaos in the explorable areas the Underworld, Scarred Earth, The Courtyard, and The Hall of Heroes.

The Primeval Kings of Elona were buried here from 229 DR until 652 DR, when the Scarab Plague decimated the population of Istan and wiped out the Royal House of the Primeval Dynasty. 400 years later, Lord Odran opened a portal from here to the Rift. After he died, the portal could be accessed by anyone, and mortals would travel regularly into the Mists to battle each other for the Favor of the Gods. 

This arrangement lasted for 200 years, until, just after the Wintersday celebrations in 1272 DR, the forces of Dhuum and Abaddon interrupted the tournament. They defeated the spirits of Warmarshal Turai, Lord Victo, and the Primeval monarchs, and began to slip through Odran's portal into the mortal world. By this point they had attracted the attention of both the Zaishen Order and the Order of the Sunspears, organizations that now fight back the darkness. 

As compensation for the destroyed tournament grounds, the Zaishen have offered access to their home on the Battle Isles for all the stranded fighters. On these isles, another portal opened by Odran in Heroes' Ascent lies ready for use.

## Vulture Drifts

Vulture Drifts is dotted with ruins of a failed civilization, overcome by the unforgiving nature of the Crystal Desert. In the northwest, a circular series of strange monuments, perhaps tombs, surrounding a large skeleton of an unknown creature.

### Dunes of Despair

*The barren desert landscape here is broken only by tall, surprisingly urban-like ruins that mark a people's failed attempt at Ascension. Made of wood from the ships that brought them to the desert's shores and bricks made of sand and mud, the structures have withstood the harsh desert weather surprisingly well. The people who built them, unfortunately did not...*

Dunes of Despair is a mission outpost. It is one of the three trials to open the path of Ascension. It is the home of the Temple of Ascension and the Throne of Pellentia that resides within the temple.

### Temple of Ascension

The Temple of Ascension was built by Turai Ossa and the Elonians in the south-west corner of the Crystal Desert to draw the attention of the Gods. Inside the temple is the Throne of Pellentia. After Turai's failure to ascend, the Temple fell into the hands of the Forgotten and enchanted armor. The Throne is now claimed by the other Ghostly Hero. 

In the Dunes of Despair mission, the player is required to reach, take over and hold the temple against the waves of Forgotten and enchanted armor attackers.

#### Throne of Pellentia

The Throne of Pellentia is a throne in the Temple of Ascension. It was built by Turai Ossa and the Elonians to draw the attention of the gods. Those seeking Ascension would stand on the Throne and hope to be judged worthy of Ascension.

### Vulture Drifts Graveyard

This graveyard is a series of Forgotten structures surrounding a pit of gargantuan bones within northwestern Vulture Drifts. Some smaller skulls of the same kind of creature are placed above and around the Forgotten structures as well.

-------------

# Depths of Tyria

*The Dwarves have provided limited information about the mysteries they have uncovered beneath the earth. Initial reports describe an immense, interconnected underground complex they call the "Depths of Tyria." These natural caves and excavated areas house structures left behind by civilizations dating back to a time before the arrival of humans in Tyria. The Depths are connected by a series of magical gateways that allow swift travel through miles of earth and stone.* 

*These gateways were created by a race known as the Asura, who use them for mining, research, and other jaunts across great distances. Most of the gates are guarded by Asuran GOLEMs, for the Depths teem with threats—both animal and geological. Those who dare to travel below realize the risk they take in doing so, and those who return tell wild stories of monsters made of fire and stone that move in the Depths.*

The Depths of Tyria, sometimes simply called the Depths, are large networks of underground caverns and tunnels underneath the Tyrian surface, filled with a variety of different structures of unknown origin, ranging from structures similar to Ascalonian buildings to statues akin to those found in the Echovald Forest and unique crystalline structures. 

Many of the races found in the Depths of Tyria are pale compared to their surface counterparts and are, on occasion, larger as well. The Depths are home to Arachnids, Skelks, Fleshreavers, Oozes, and is the origin of the Asura.

## Battledepths

The Battledepths is the only normal explorable area in the Depths of Tyria. The main chamber is empty until completing all parts of Northern Allies, after which Jalis Ironhammer and his servants appear in the northwestern corner of the map, near the exit to Varajar Fells.

### Central Transfer Chamber

*Polestar to the vast wheel of Asura Gates, the Central Transfer Chamber is a magical and architectural marvel constructed atop a major pocket of magical energy. The Asura channel that raw power to fuel all the gates in the network and link them together via this great crossroads of transport. Most of the major gates across Tyria lead to this location.*

The Central Transfer Chamber is the central hub of the Asura Gate system, though it is primarily populated by Dwarves when characters arrive.

### Heart of the Shiverpeaks

*The Heart of the Shiverpeaks, sealed long ago by the Blackpowder clan, holds many ancient Dwarven secrets. Its innermost reaches are guarded by a great fire wurm, Cyndr the Mountain Heart.*

## Beneath Lion’s Arch

This is the transition area that brings players from Guild Wars Prophecies into Guild Wars Eye of the North.

## Caverns Below Kamadan

This is the transition area that brings players from Guild Wars Nightfall into Guild Wars Eye of the North.

## Secret Lair of the Snowmen

*Home to Freezie and his snowmen cadre, the Secret Lair is a less-than-pleasant place. Its inhabitants live inside this cavern awaiting the arrival of Wintersday, when Dwayna calls upon them to bring joy, snowballs, and presents, [sic] to everyone. (And death to Grentches.) The Dwarf King Hundar, a rather famous ale brewer and former leader of Deldrimor, stumbled upon this location years ago, never to be seen again.*

## Tunnels Below Cantha

This is the transition area that brings players from Factions to Eye of the North.

------------------

# Janthir

Janthir is the desolate-looking island north of Kryta where Saul D'Alessio claimed the Eye of Janthir for the White Mantle to perform the Test of the Chosen. The inhabitants of the island are said to have the gift of True Sight, the ability to see someone for who they really are.

--------------

# Krytan Kingdom

*There are two types of humans in Kryta: those who worship the mysterious Unseen Ones and those who do not. The worshippers have become known as the White Mantle because of the long white sleeveless robes many of them wear.* 

*It is the responsibility of the White Mantle to oversee the other humans and impose upon them the rules and laws of the Unseen Ones. Those inside the organization receive special privileges (more food, better clothing, access to books) simply for abiding by the rules of the Unseen Ones and carrying out the orders handed down by the White Mantle high priest. To the Krytans the White Mantle are the root of law and order, the protectors or saviors, if you will, of their lands.* 

*The White Mantle maintain a series of temples all over the continent. Members of this organization frequently, though not always, choose to reside in these temples to better perform their duties to the Mantle and to more effectively worship the Unseen Ones.* 

*Since the end of the last Guild War and the repelling of the Charr invasion, the White Mantle have maintained a high level of military preparedness. They don’t ever want to be caught off guard again, and they often keep large stores of weapons inside their temples to use in case of emergency. It’s also not uncommon for followers of the Mantle philosophy to be highly trained warriors. Fighting skills will come in handy if the day comes when they will need to once again defend Kryta from invasion.*

Kryta was the third and last human kingdom to be established in Tyria. Originally a colony of Elona, it was established in 300 AE, it gained its independence in 358 AE. The kingdom's royal family are descendants of King Doric, however it is not known how far Doric's lineage goes into the Krytan royalty. There have been few notable members of this royalty, outside the last king, King Jadon, the only known monarch is Mad King Thorn. Those of the royal bloodline are buried in the Mausoleum, which is guarded by the undead dragon Rotscale. 

Kryta is home to many important landmarks, such as the Wizard's Tower and the Temple of the Ages. It is also the origin of the now-mysterious Druids, former Krytans who left into the Maguuma Jungle to the west long ago. 

Sometime in the distant past, several large watchtowers were built along the northern coast to defend Kryta against a threat to the north.

*The White Mantle suffered losses when the veil of godhood was lifted from their so-called deities, exposing the Mursaat as powerful, yet mortal, creatures. The revelation of this manipulation and deceit fueled a revolt in Kryta, led by the Shining Blade—and Kryta fell into civil war. The strongest force for unification, the Shining Blade are scattered and losing power, forced to deal with too many enemies at once. It has become Blade against Mantle, royalists against warlords. All fight one another for control of Kryta.* 

*In an attempt to find a way to turn the tides of war in their favor, both the Shining Blade and the White Mantle have sent agents across the reaches of Tyria, searching for powerful allies or magics. Each side has vowed to bring peace to Kryta—no matter the cost.*

Since the completion of the Flameseeker Prophecies, there has been a constant civil war between the White Mantle and the Shining Blade. In 1079 AE, the war escalated with the White Mantle hiring bandits in the guise of Peacekeepers and the Shining Blade allying with Salma and the Lionguard. With most Mursaat killed, the Shining Blade focused on taking the throne in Lion's Arch Keep and removing the few remaining Mursaat from ruling behind the White Mantle with assassinations. 

Eventually, after the peaceful reclaim of the throne and death of the White Mantle Inquisitors, the White Mantle led an all-out assault on Lion's Arch. However, unknown to Salma and her allies, they led forces into the Maguuma Jungle to lay low and, over time, spread dissent against the crown. Now, Kryta is under royal rule again but still faces division, protected by the Lionguard and the newly formed Seraph.

*Travelers to Kryta will find a stark contrast between the fortified, polished-stone buildings of the White Mantle and the thatch-roofed huts of the regular citizens. There is a surprising amount of wealth here, but it is kept in the hands of those who adhere to the doctrines of the Mantle, and this is reflected in the architecture of the region.* 

*On the coast, the weather is hot and humid. This is somewhat mitigated by the beautiful white-sand beaches and the crystal-clear blue saltwater beyond. Farther inland, it cools down a bit, making the area ideal for farming and raising livestock. Those Krytans who don't practice any of the mystical arts tend to gravitate towards fishing and farming.*

Kryta's landscape is a mixture of coasts complete with tall trunked palm trees (contrasting the small trunked large leafed palms of Maguuma Jungle), swamps with weeping trees, valleys, and farmland. Villages dot the land, even going into the wilderness like Dakutu Village, though despite this there are plenty of unsettled lands filled with Tengu and wildlife. The many swamps of Kryta are often filled with skale, and are used to send the Krytans' wrapped dead off on sail boats.1 To the north of Kryta lies the two large salt water lakes that make up Giant's Basin. Beyond the Giant's Basin lies the Woodland Cascades, while to the west lies the Maguuma Jungle.

## Cursed Lands

The Cursed Lands is a small area between Nebo Terrace and The Black Curtain.

## D’Alessio Seaboard

*Once called the Eastbury Reserve, this stretch of coastal land was renamed after the last Guild War. Its namesake, Saul D'Alessio, was the founder of the White Mantle and is thought by many to be the savior of Kryta.*

The D'Alessio Seaboard is a mission outpost and home to the Temple of Tolerance. It is constantly assaulted by the Orrian undead.

### Hakewood

Hakewood, once a county, is now but a small village located south west of D'Alessio Seaboard which plays an important role in the mission which starts there.

### Temple of Tolerance

The Temple of Tolerance is a temple built by the White Mantle. It lies west of D'Alessio Seaboard.

## Divinity Coast

*The Divinity Coast is the site of several of the region's oldest settlements. Humans have occupied these lands for over seven hundred years. Many generations of Krytan fishermen have grown up trolling the same sacred waters of the Giant's Basin, the huge saltwater lake that defines the northern edge of the coast.*

Divinity Coast is a mission outpost.

### Loamhurst

Loamhurst is a fishing village in northwestern Kryta that overlooks the Divinity Coast. The caravans of Chosen rally at this village before being led into the depths of the Maguuma Jungle. It is the final destination of the Divinity Coast mission and can only be accessed from within that mission. 

There is a shrine located in the village, which appears to be a location where the Eye of Janthir is kept.

### Shaemoor

Shaemoor is a village in Divinity Coast. It is where Justiciar Hablion asks you to take the Eye of Janthir from him. The Fountain of Truth is just outside the city gates as well.

#### Fountain of Truth

The Fountain of Truth stands on the eastern edge of Shaemoor village, atop a hill with several Tablets of Janthir. It is separated from Shaemoor by a gate. 

The fountain's waters are considered special and are said to cleanse people of their sins, which in turn allows for the individuals who washed themselves in these waters to transport the Eye of Janthir. Cleansing themselves in the waters is a required task of those administering the Test of the Chosen.

## Giant’s Basin

Giant's Basin is the combination of two large salt lakes on the northern edge of Kryta - Lesser Giant's Basin is north of North Kryta Province and the larger of the two lakes lies north of both Watchtower Coast and Divinity Coast. The village of Demetra resides between the two.

## Kessex Peak

Kessex Peak is one of the highest points of land within the region of Kryta.

### Wizard’s Tower

The Wizard's Tower is a big, fortress-like building consisting of a center tower and 5 side-towers. It sits on a mysterious rock floating in mid-air at the south-western edge of Kessex Peak. 

You can see the tower up close from Kessex Peak, and you can also see it clearly from the opposite side of the bay in the Fishermen's Haven and Stingray Strand. 

It is currently unknown who the wizard was that the tower belongs to and what powers are hidden in the tower, but a villain named Galrath seeks access to the tower. In the quest The Villainy of Galrath you have to stop Galrath from gaining access to the tower. In addition, the Cult of Verata has based its operations by the tower, perhaps also to gain access to what is inside. 

During the War in Kryta, Justiciar Marron attempted to finish what Galrath started by gaining access to the Wizard's Tower.

## Lion’s Gate

Located south of Lion's Arch, this small extension consists of a quarantined area for processing foreign arrivals and the lighthouse. 

When traveling to Tyria from another campaign, characters will be placed here before entering Lion's Arch. To travel to Elona for the first time, characters will also need to come in here.

### Lion’s Gate Lighthouse

The Lion's Gate lighthouse illuminates the bay south of the Lion's Arch harbor and warns ships of the rocky headland. It is situated inside the town of Lion's Arch on the southernmost path.

## Majesty’s Rest

Majesty's Rest is a remote area that marks the transition between Kryta and the Maguuma Jungle. One of the game's most powerful foes, Rotscale, makes his home outside The Mausoleum. The Scepter of Orr was hidden in one of the buildings within this area until the White Mantle recovered it.

### The Mausoleum

The Mausoleum is the tomb for Kryta's royalty that resides within the center of a lake in Majesty's Rest. Since its trek into Kryta, Rotscale and his undead have made it into its home.

The Mausoleum is the resting place of many nobles, and is filled with the undead.

The zone extends far past location of the sarcophogi, but there are no other foes, interactive objects, or anything other than eye-candy.

The extended area includes what appears to be non-functional Asura Gates, and its style is very similar to many dungeons in Eye of the North. Some players even refer to this place as the Halloween dungeon, although the game calls it an explorable area and it has no final boss (though Rotscale guards the entrance) nor end chest.

The Mausoleum map itself is a reuse of Slavers' Exile and Caverns Below Kamadan which exist in Eye of the North. This is the reason no location appears on the world map, compass map, or the mini map in game.

## Nebo Terrace

Nebo Terrace is a well populated province in north-central Kryta. There are settlements along all the edges and a central village, also named Nebo. In the southwest, undead from the swamps are making incursions.

### Beetletun

Beetletun is a small outpost between the Divinity Coast, Bergen Hot Springs and Lion's Arch.

*Historians speculate that in time out of mind, these now-ruined watchtowers guarded Kryta from some unknown northern threat. Now the crumbled towers stand like ancient stone soldiers still awaiting the arrival of that mysterious enemy from across the great saltwater lake called Giant's Basin.*

### Bergen Hot Springs

Bergen Hot Springs is a small outpost in the southeastern part of Nebo Terrace.

*The healing properties of these hot springs are renowned across the continent of Tyria. Pilgrims travel from all corners in hopes of being cured of what ails them, from rheumatism to gut rot to demonic possession. Water taken from the Bergen Hot springs is a key ingredient in potions and salves used by village medics far and wide.*

### Demetra

Demetra is a small village situated in the area north of Nebo Terrace. It was Saul D'Alessio's base of operations during his last fight. It is not known what became of it since the Charr invasion was repelled, however there are rumours of a large number of White Mantle troops gathering here during the events of the Krytan civil war.

### Nebo Village

Nebo Village is a small settlement in Nebo Terrace.

### Peacekeeper Camp

The Peacekeeper camp is a large area within Nebo Terrace's southwestern corner that is full of Peacekeepers.

## North Kryta Province

North Kryta Province is, as the name suggests, a large province in northern Kryta. It is also the location of the Ascalon Settlement.

### Ascalon Settlement

The Ascalon Settlement in North Kryta Province is where the refugees from Ascalon settled after crossing the Shiverpeak Mountains with Prince Rurik to escape the Charr invasion.

### Lion’s Arch

*The seat of power in Kryta, Lion's Arch housed the royal palace of King Doric and his line until after the last Guild War. Now, the White Mantle run the city. The old buildings have all been razed, making space for barracks and more practical structures.*

Lion's Arch is the main city of the Kingdom of Kryta and the primary trading port of the continent of Tyria.

## Riverside Province

*The Ullen River originates from the farthest south of the Footprint Lakes. The River flows west into the jungle, then turns decidedly south at the Henge of Denravi. Its swift currents and shallow inlets would make it an ideal trading river but for the fact that there are few settlements on its banks.*

Riverside Province is a mission outpost.

### Temple of the Unseen

The Temple of the Unseen is a heavily guarded White Mantle temple in the eastern area of Riverside Province. It is accessible through the mission there and by talking to Blade Operative Paulina in Sanctum Cay as part of the War in Kryta.

### Ullen River

The Ullen River (better known by locals as the Dark River), flows from the far north of Tears of the Fallen through the swamps of Twin Serpent Lakes and past Riverside Province into the jungle, then turns south to the Henge of Denravi, and ends at Tangle Root where it flows into the swamps. It is called the Dark River not just for the darkness of the passage through the cliffs but also for a perceived darkness that shrouds this river.

## Soundrel’s Rise

Scoundrel's Rise refers to the small sandy area that lies on the eastern border of Kryta. It's possible that this area used to be submerged as there are many shipwrecks dotting the area.

### Gates of Kryta

*Once embroiled in a devastating war with Orr and Ascalon, Kryta is now the only thriving human kingdom left on the continent of Tyria. Travelers venturing here from over the treacherous Shiverpeak Mountains will find themselves in the foothills outside the grand city of Lion's Arch.*

Gates of Kryta is a mission outpost.

## Stingray Strand

Stingray Strand is a beautiful stretch of idyllic beach on the western side of Kryta, that is unfortunately marred by the presence of hostile Tengu and dangerous Skale.

### Fishermen’s Haven

*This beautiful cove is said to be the home to the best fishing in all of Kryta. Legends tell of a time when the fish were so plentiful here that one had only to skim the surface with a net to take in the equivalent of a full day's catch from any other body of water. Whether the legends be true or not, Krytan fishermen, both professional and casual, can often be found on the shores of Fishermen's Haven.*

Fishermen's Haven is an out of the way outpost north of Sanctum Cay. It offers a decent view of the Wizard's Tower.

## Sanctum Cay

*This beautiful harbor is a favorite landing for cargo ships traveling to Kryta from the nation of Cantha. To the southeast lie the ruins of an ancient monastery said to have been the first to teach the art of Smiting Prayers, making the transformation for Krytan Monks from passive healers to aggressive defenders of the land.*

Sanctum Cay is a mission outpost.

### Sanctum Cay Monastery

An unnamed abandoned monastery on Sanctum Cay once belonged to a school of Smiting Monks. It is used by the Shining Blade and Vizier Khilbron as the rendezvous point when they exchange the Scepter of Orr.

## Talmark Wilderness

Talmark Wilderness is a large area of rolling hills and wilderness in northwestern Kryta. A river runs through its southern parts, and south of that river the people of Dakutu Village cultivate the land.

### Dakutu Village

Dakutu Village is a small settlement in the southwest corner of Talmark Wilderness. The villagers are followers of the Krytan royal family. 

During the Krytan civil war, the villagers give their aid to the Shining Blade and Princess Salma through housing the Shining Blade camp near the end of the war.

### Shining Blade Camp

The Shining Blade camp is located in Dakutu Village in Talmark Wilderness. It acts as the Shining Blade's main base of operations during the later portion of the Krytan civil war.

### Talmark Pillars

The Talmark pillars, located in Talmark Wilderness, is a structure of four pillars in a circle. Their surface resembles bark and their base creates a series of spirals. Each pillar has Old Krytan runes; however, their meanings are unknown.

Similar pillars can be seen connected to the chains of the Wizard's Folly tower.

### Zinn’s Laboratory

Zinn's laboratory is a secret research site, where the ostracized Asuran conducts research into methods for combating Mursaat to help win the War in Kryta. Hidden from the prying eyes of the White Mantle, it can only be reached through the Secret River Passage in the Talmark Wilderness (around the corner from the portal to The Black Curtain). 

To help him work on a technological solution, Zinn has generated a Loose Magic field, which causes all magical effects to expire instantly.

## Tears of the Fallen

Tears of the Fallen is a small, Bog Skale-infested area in Kryta. The area likely gets its name from the two tear-shaped pools that are found just a short distance from the beach. Small hillside farms can be found on the west side of the lakes.

## The Black Curtain

The Black Curtain is the largest part of the marsh that covers central Kryta.

### Temple of the Ages

*From time immemorial the Temple of the Ages has stood in this protected location just inland of the Divinity Coast. The elements have taken their toll on the temple, and even the statues of the gods are now little more than piles of rubble. Still, this sacred place holds a magic that attracts the bold and the adventurous. Some say that the stones themselves will rise up one day and rebuild the temple, and on that day, the gods will once again turn their gaze upon Kryta.*

The Temple of the Ages is where ascended characters assemble to form parties for ventures into the Realms of the Gods. Sometime before his disappearance, Saul D'Alessio formed a special edict for the Temple of the Ages to be unchanged by the White Mantle's faith in the Unseen Ones.

## Twin Serpent Lakes

The name of this area is derived from its two lakes—one in the north, the other in the south. These lakes resemble the heads of serpents (though to some, footprints), and together with the winding natural passes between the northern and southern halves gives the impression of two serpents, intertwined. The lake's waters and the streams that feed them makes this a bountiful hunting grounds—many different creatures call this place home, including the Caromi Tengu.

## Watchtower Coast

Watchtower Coast is a relatively peaceful area in northern Kryta, named for the ancient watchtowers that dot the landscape. The towers, legend has it, were built to fend off some unknown threat from across Giant's Basin, but their true purpose remains unknown.

# Maguuma Jungle

*Years ago, many tribes of human druids lived among the Maguuma's lush greenery and wildlife. But it has been a long time since anyone has heard word from them, and many believe that they were eaten by hostile jungle creatures or simply swallowed whole by the man-eating plants now rampant in the jungle.* 

*The higher elevations are mostly devoid of water. Only the largest and hardiest of plants can live here. But down farther, closer to the water table, the Maguuma grows thick. The vegetation can become so dense that there are areas of the jungle floor that have never been touched by the sun's light.*

The Maguuma Jungle is a deep canyon subdivided into three regions. The lowest point of the canyon is lush and humid with abundant vegetation, while the higher elevations become drier and more arid with its highest point being devoid of most plant life. 

The Jungle is the home of one of the five bloodstones and contains enchanted waters. Due to its overgrown nature, some view it to be like a maze and get lost or turned around within the foliage and its many paths. Despite being called a jungle, the higher elevated portions of the area are very arid and almost desert-like. Those portions tend to be riddled with canyons and crevices creating off oases where the water settles. The southern portion of the Maguuma Jungle is the Tarnished Coast. 

It is the home of Centaurs, Trolls, Riders, the Druids, and a large variety of insects and living plants. Among the jungle, even in the arid portions, thrives the gargantuan stonewood trees. Palm trees with short stems and large leaves and bamboo are common in the oasis areas.

## Aurora Glade

*A long time ago, a tribe of human druids ventured into the jungle to make peace with the jungle. For many years they lived in harmony with the Maguuma, making their home in the Aurora Glade. Though there are rumors, no one has actually seen or heard from any of the druids in over a hundred years.*

### Henge Portal

The Henge Portal is, as the name implies, a portal which leads to the Henge of Denravi. It resides within Aurora Glade and has to be activated by tuning three Rune Crystals and Thorn Pedestals. The other side of the Henge Portal is guarded by the Henge Guardian.

## Bloodstone Fen

*The floor of the jungle is damp and uninviting to anyone but thirsty beasts. In one particularly deep chasm lies the remnants of a powerful magical stone, said to be a relic from the time when the gods walked on Tyria. Not even the voracious vegetation of the Maguuma will grow upon its surface.*

### Bloodstone

The bloodstones are five shards of a massive stone created by the Gods of Tyria and sealed with the blood of King Doric. They broke the stone into five pieces. Four of these pieces represent the four schools of magic (aggression, destruction, preservation, and denial), and the final piece, the Keystone, was needed to reassemble the Bloodstone. The five pieces were then tossed into the volcano, Abaddon's Mouth. Later, following an eruption, four of the pieces were spread across Tyria, while one remained on the Ring of Fire Island Chain, near the caldera. 

At least two of the bloodstones are used by the White Mantle and Mursaat to sacrifice the Chosen. When slain, the Chosens' souls are channeled into the soul batteries - structures created by the Mursaat to keep the Door of Komalie, and ultimately the Titans sealed away. 

All three bloodstones have an environmental effect that influences activation time of resurrection skills or triggers an effect when someone is killed. Near the bloodstones, either the Curse of the Bloodstone or the Aura of the Bloodstone will appear. 

Two of the three found bloodstones hold inscriptions, which are also on some doors and seals in the Bloodstone Caves. Each inscription, however, changes slightly between the three locations.

Maguuma Jungle bloodstone - Located deep within the Maguuma Jungle within the Bloodstone Fen. In the Bloodstone Fen mission, players witness Justiciar Hablion killing Chosen atop it.

## Dry Top

Dry Top is a rather small circular map area, which connects the rest of the Maguuma Jungle to Tangle Root. There are no allies, no bosses, nor much of interest in Dry Top; with the exception of what appears to be hillside settlements, as well as a large tree stump in the central clearing. Though most of the land is dry and barren, the sides and bottom of the ravine just west of the center of the map is covered in vegetation as seen in most of the Maguuma Jungle.

## Ettin’s Back

Ettin's Back takes its name from the dry uneven terrain, the "humps" (such as those of an ettin), that encompass this part of the Maguuma Jungle. Ventari's Refuge lies within its western half. This is a hostile area with marauding centaurs and hidden dangers.

### Ventari’s Refuge

*Named for a wise old Centaur with a penchant for peaceful living, visitors to this outpost do their business among the roots of a gargantuan stonewood tree, the largest known specimen of its kind.*

Surrounded by Ettin's Back, Ventari's Refuge is a small outpost that is named for its peaceable resident centaur. Ventari's Refuge does not serve a different purpose than any of the other outposts of Maguuma Jungle.

## Majesty’s Rest

Majesty's Rest is a remote area that marks the transition between Kryta and the Maguuma Jungle. One of the game's most powerful foes, Rotscale, makes his home outside The Mausoleum. The Scepter of Orr was hidden in one of the buildings within this area until the White Mantle recovered it.

## Mamnoon Lagoon

The Mamnoon Lagoon is a difficult place to access deep in the jungle, surrounded by behemoths and guarded by patrols of six Wind Riders; it can be a dangerous area to the careless traveler.

## Reed Bog

The Reed Bog is a circular area. Two paths circle around a depression filled with fetid waters.

## Sage Lands

The Sage Lands are the border lands of Kryta and the Maguuma Jungle. Rebels, outlaws, and ancient druids regard this place as a sanctuary from the White Mantle.

### Druid’s Overlook

*Located in the dry upper region of the Maguuma Jungle, Druid's Overlook provides a spectacular and deceptively pleasant view of the harsh and deadly Sage Lands below. This area was once home to a sacred fountain dedicated to Dwayna, whose statue now lies in pieces in the brush.*

Druid's Overlook is the first oasis within the Maguuma Jungle from Kryta. It is home to the one of the few statues of the Gods of Tyria within the jungle.

## Silverwood

Silverwood is a lush area of the Maguuma Jungle populated largely by centaurs. A Shining Blade outpost lies near the center of the area, at the Quarrel Falls.

### Quarrel Falls

*Deep within the Maguuma Jungle lies a tiny outpost surrounded by waterfalls. So lovely and scenic is this place that adventurers often spend more time here than is strictly necessary to re-supply. Situated as it is just outside Silverwood, Quarrel Falls is like the eye of the hurricane; a calm place to rest before the storm begins once again.*

Quarrel Falls lies in the middle of Silverwood. This outpost's main function is as a primary quest host outpost, and to bridge Bloodstone Fen and Ventari's Refuge.

## Tangle Root

Tangle Root is a large area towards the south of the Maguuma Jungle which borders the concealed Henge of Denravi. The eastern part of this zone is a confusing layout of water-filled canyons crossed above by thick wooden trunks, and is home to numerous trolls and skale.

### Henge of Denravi

*The Henge of Denravi was once a sacred meeting place for the druids of the Maguuma Jungle. It fell into disuse after the druids mysteriously disappeared more than a decade ago. The only way to enter the Henge is to be granted access through the Henge Gate, and only those who have already been to Denravi can find their way back.*

The Henge of Denravi is the largest settlement in the Maguuma Jungle; however; it does not have as many NPCs as the other towns.

### Maguuma Stade

*Far from any human civilizations, Maguuma Stade is thought to have been a meeting place for the druids who long inhabited this part of the jungle. The elements and grasping vines have all but erased the evidence that anyone was ever here.*

This tiny outpost, hidden in the southern reaches of Tangle Root, is easy to miss when following the storyline between Aurora Glade and Riverside Province, as players are directed quickly through the jungle outside the Henge of Denravi to points eastward.

### Ullen River

The Ullen River (better known by locals as the Dark River), flows from the far north of Tears of the Fallen through the swamps of Twin Serpent Lakes and past Riverside Province into the jungle, then turns south to the Henge of Denravi, and ends at Tangle Root where it flows into the swamps. It is called the Dark River not just for the darkness of the passage through the cliffs but also for a perceived darkness that shrouds this river.

## The Falls

The Falls are among the most spectacular sights in the Maguuma Jungle, but travelers seldom have the time for sightseeing with all the skale, trolls, and other unsavory creatures trying to eat them. A lucky or persistent adventurer may come across a Forgotten Fan or Totem Axe here.

The Falls is a group of large waterfalls located deep within the Maguuma Jungle. It is the entrance to Zinn's Secret Underground Lair.

### Temple of Balthazar

The Temple of Balthazar is located in the southwest area of The Falls. It is an enclave with a statue of Balthazar which is surrounded by a unique kind of architecture that is partially overgrown. Outside of the temple are several groups of Jungle Trolls and Jungle Skales, as well as several ruined, raided wagons.

## the Wilds

*The Maguuma Jungle is perhaps the most dangerous place on the continent of Tyria. The Krytans don't often venture inside its borders, and those who do are seldom heard from again. Stories of man-eating plants and gigantic insects are commonly told around the campfires and inside the huts of the local villages; most of the time to scare little children from wandering into its clinging vines.*

# Orr

*Situated on a peninsula south of Ascalon and west of the Crystal Desert, Orr was a vibrant, proud, and prosperous nation. Its citizens were the favored of the gods, living in the shadows of Arah, the deserted city once inhabited by the likes of Melandru, Dwayna, and Balthazar. Deeply spiritual, the Orrians looked after the buildings and structures left behind when the gods left Tyria, caring for them in the hopes that one day, the divine beings who created magic and bestowed it upon the world would return.* 

*The Orrians were a peaceful people, hoping only to do their duty toward their gods and content to be rewarded in either this life or the next. When the guilds began feuding, Orr as a nation tried to stay out of the conflict. This was not the sort of struggle that entire kingdoms got involved in. But when the strife overflowed into armed conflict, and guilds from the other human nations began fighting in the streets of Arah, Orr rose to defend itself and the city of the gods.* 

*Soon after Orr mobilized its armies, Kryta and Ascalon did as well, and what had started as a dispute between localized groups became an all-out war. The Guild Wars raged for nearly fifty years. During that time, none of the three human empires was able to assert dominance over either of the other two. While Ascalon, Orr, and Kryta were busy fighting with each other, they became blind to the threat from the north—the Charr. The northern beasts swept in, taking Ascalon in a spectacular magical battle.* 

 *At first, Orr was saved from much of the fighting. The guilds with allegiances to Ascalon and Kryta withdrew, heading back to defend their homes. Orr regrouped, granted a moment to prepare simply because they were farther south. The Charr had to make their way through Ascalon before they could reach the gates of Arah. But eventually Ascalon fell, and the Charr arrived in Orr.* 

*Hopes were high that the Charr would be defeated quickly. The Orrian army was the equal of any in Tyria, and the invaders had already fought a long battle against the Ascalons. But those hopes were dashed in less than twelve hours.* 

*The invaders reached the gates of Arah without breaking stride. The Orrians failed to protect their charge. With defeat at the doorstep and the kingdom nearly in ruins, one man turned to a forbidden magic. The king's own personal advisor in the matters of the arcane took it upon himself to destroy the invaders, no matter the cost. Unrolling one of the Lost Scrolls, kept inside a warded vault deep within the catacombs below Arah, he spoke the words of a litany that spelled the end of the Kingdom of Orr forever.* 

*There are few who survived that day, now known as the Cataclysm. While the Charr were never allowed to step foot in Arah, few count what the king’s advisor did on that day as a victory. The resulting explosion felled the invading army where it stood, but so too did it sink the entire peninsula, leaving only a scattering of small islands in its place. The beautiful city of Arah was consumed. What’s left above water now lies in a pile of ruins, blackened by the Cataclysm and years of neglect. All that remains in the wreckage of Orr are the wandering dead—those souls unable to rest in the shadow of this great disaster.*

The Kingdom of Orr was the first human kingdom established on the continent of Tyria, created by both god and man.[1] From 100 BE, the kingdom was ruled alongside Ascalon by King Doric until his death in 1BE. Orr gained its independence in the year 2 AE. At the time of the Second Great Corsair War and King Zoran's reign, Orrian territory is known to have extended into the Tarnished Coast, and included the caverns now known as the Shards of Orr. Orr was once the most vibrant, proud, and prosperous human nation in the known world. Its citizens believed themselves to be the favored of the Six Human Gods, living in the shadows of Arah which was once inhabited by the gods themselves. Orr was known nexus of arcane activity and research; in the Orrian History Scrolls, an unknown Ascalonian author expresses shock at the casual way with which magic was viewed by the citizens of Orr, which is now known to be a place of extremely high magic concentration. Since its sinking in the Cataclysm in 1071 AE, it has been inhabited by both wandering undead and corsairs seeking refuge and to pillage. 

The Elder Dragon Zhaitan resides underneath Orr.

# Ring of Fire Islands

*Just south of the Tarnished Coast lie the volcanic islands that together make up the Ring of Fire. The large volcano at the center of the ring is where the gods reportedly dropped the Bloodstones before leaving Tyria for good. Of the islands that surround this one, many are still active. Ships that pass by the Ring report hearing the tell-tale hiss of scalding hot lava hitting the ocean, instantly vaporizing the saltwater into steam.* 

*The reefs off the islands are formed of black pumice stone. There are very few natural ports, and those that might be suitable for docking would bring the crew of the ship within danger of being caught by a sudden, unexpected eruption.* 

*There are no known settlements in the Ring of Fire.*

The Ring of Fire Islands is the home of one of the five bloodstones and of the volcano known as Abaddon's Mouth, which is possesed by evil, supernatural forces which have caused the lava to harden into formations resembling monstrous faces. The islands are inhabited by few sapient creatures, save for the Mursaat, who reside within the Onyx Gate, a large fortress designed to defend the Door of Komalie and keep its inhabitants sealed. 

Despite the islands' seemingly constant volcanic activity, plant life-manages to thrive long enough to grow into full trees. Little vegetation can be found on the island chain, save the burnt trees and a small island to its western coasts. Many creatures manage to thrive in the hostile environments, including Riders, Arachnids, Dryders, Drakes, Wurms, Behemoths, and Abominations.

## Abaddon’s Mouth

*The largest volcano in the Ring of Fire Island Chain, Abaddon's Mouth is rumored to be the gateway into the Underworld. But only demons and devils would dare enter the fiery chasm. All other risk being burned to cinders before even getting to magma's edge.*

## Hell’s Precipice

*The switchback route that runs along the ridge of Abaddon's Mouth is known to any who have ventured here as Hell's Precipice. One look into the caldera of the furious volcano will explain why.*

## Perdition Rock

Perdition Rock is the only explorable area in the Ring of Fire Islands. It's home to some of the most dangerous foes of Tyria such as Mahgo Hydras, Drakes and Dark Flame Dryders.

### Ember Light Camp

*Just on the edge of the Ring of Fire, the Ember Light Camp was established by a group of sailors whose corsair was shipwrecked here during a terrible storm. There is little left today of the original camp except the story of the men who lived to tell the tale.*

Ember Light Camp is the only non-mission outpost in the Ring of Fire Island Chain. From Ember Light Camp players can exit into Perdition Rock.

## Ring of Fire

*The large volcano at the center of this ring is where the gods reportedly dropped the legendary Bloodstones before leaving Tyria for good. Of the volcanic island that surround this one, many are still active. Ships that pass by the Ring report hearing the tell-tale hiss of scalding hot lava hitting the ocean, instantly vaporizing the saltwater into steam.*

---------------

# Shiverpeak Mountains

*For hundreds of years, all the dwarves in this mountain range were united under one flag: the nation of the Deldrimor dwarves. Most of the architecture in the Shiverpeaks was built during this time, and it reflects a time of peace and prosperity—but that time is over now. Today, the mountains ring with the sounds of civil war, and new architecture has sprung up: slabs of stone lashed together with huge iron chains mark the areas where a new guild—those who have broken from the old ways—have made new settlements.* 

*The Shiverpeaks are an inhospitable environment for the ill-prepared. There are only two known passes through the mountains, and any wishing to cross them must endure freezing wind, flash snow storms, and unstable terrain that shifts with the change in temperature.*

The Shiverpeak Mountains, often simply referred to as "the Shiverpeaks," are a massive mountain range rising up over ten-thousand feet above sea level, and running from north to south almost across the whole continent of Tyria. They are home to the Dwarves, the Norn, Centaurs, Tengu, Dredge, and various wildlife, both dangerous and benign. 

The Shiverpeak Mountains begin from the northernmost areas of the known world and stretch down all the way to the northwestern border of the Crystal Desert. They form an imposing barrier between the human kingdoms of Ascalon and Kryta to the east and west respectively. The Woodland Cascades and the Charr Homelands border the mountain range in the northwestern and northeastern areas, respectively.

With soaring peaks reaching high into the sky, the ice of the Shiverpeaks never melts, and it snows year round. Because the majority of the lakes and rivers in and around the mountains are frozen most of the time, conventional ships find it impossible to traverse them, though the Dwarven ice ships can pass over them with ease. 

Winding tundra passes, sluggish glaciers, frozen taiga forests, frosted marsh plains, blinding sheer cliffs and snow fallen hills make up the majority of the terrain between the mountain peaks, and life can be encountered anywhere. 

Regions: While geographically the same, game mechanics divided the Shiverpeak Mountains into three portions that each has their own inhabitants and dangers: 

·        The Northern Shiverpeaks actually form the central section of the mountain range, reaching between Beacon's Perch northward until Boreal Station. They are often used as a pass between Kryta and Ascalon and is the least dangerous of the three.

·        The Southern Shiverpeaks encompasses the part of the mountain range to the south of Beacon's Perch and houses the capital of Deldrimor and the primary base of the Stone Summit. The northern and southern regions are connected by Lornar's Pass that contains long winding valleys.

·        The Far Shiverpeaks lie to the far north to the Northern Shiverpeaks and is outside of the Dwarves' rule, instead they are inhabited by Jotun, Norn, and Modniir Centaurs and are littered with ruins of an unknown ancient civilization

-----------

# Northern Shiverpeaks

The Northern Shiverpeaks are, despite the name, a central region within the Shiverpeak Mountains. Inhabited mainly by the Deldrimor and Stone Summit Dwarves, they are also occupied by Centaurs and Ettins. They are often used as the primary route to cross the Shiverpeaks, with the Frost Gate barring one of two passes. There are few to no primary Deldrimor settlements in the Northern Shiverpeaks, but the Stone Summit are known to have mines here.

## Anvil Rock

Anvil Rock is an area that takes its name from a tall mountain in the shape of an anvil. Small groups of Minotaurs patrol the central bit of the area as well as the north, whilst groups of Stone Summit and Centaurs can be found in the south. Some Dryders can also be found.

Anvil Rock is a large anvil-shaped mountain peak located in the Northern Shiverpeaks. It is sacred to the Dwarfs because legends claim that this place was once used by the Great Dwarf as a forge. For ages, clan leaders held summit at the foot of the mountain, in Ice Tooth Cave, in hopes of peace and the Great Dwarf returning. However, these meetings no longer occur.

### Ice Tooth Cave

*Just outside of Ice Tooth Cave, Dwarven clan leaders held parley at Anvil Rock, a sacred site said to have been the forge of the Great Dwarf himself. The Dwarven clans no longer meet for purposes of peace, and no one holds out hope that the Great Dwarf will ever return to Tyria, so this icy place receives few visitors.*

Ice Tooth Cave is a desolate outpost in the northwestern most portion of the Northern Shiverpeaks.

## Borlis Pass

*The Shiverpeaks rise up over ten-thousand feet above sea level. In the shadow of this enormous mountain range lie the kingdoms of Kryta to the west and Ascalon to the east. Borlis Pass is the closest travelable passage through the mountains to the city of Rin. The next closest lies much farther north, deep in Charr territory.*

Borlis Pass is a mission outpost and is one of the few passages to cross the Shiverpeak Mountains.

### Krok’s Hollow

Krok's Hollow is a small Deldrimor village in the Northern Shiverpeaks that is seen in the Borlis Pass mission. During the mission, the players can find Prince Rurik meeting with King Jalis Ironhammer of the Deldrimor Dwarves, but are quickly interrupted by besieging forces from the Stone Summit.

### Maladar’s Fort

Maladar's Fort is a Stone Summit siege fortification in Borlis Pass that was made to protect the forces besieging Krok's Hollow.

## Deldrimor Bowl

The Deldrimor Bowl is an area of relatively lower altitude than the rest of the Northern Shiverpeaks, hence the name. It encompasses the westernmost area under the rule of the Deldrimor Dwarves and lies closest to the human kingdom of Kryta. A Dwarven settlement can be seen in the western part of this area. While free of Stone Summit presence, this area is not without its dangers, as a large population of Shiverpeak centaurs call this area home.

### Beacon’s Perch

*Named for the legendary Dwarven warrior who single-handedly held off the great Hill Giant invasion of 534 A.E., Beacon's Perch runs north and south through the Shiverpeak Mountains. Today, this treacherous pass is patrolled by the Stone Summit, and as such is considered hostile to human travelers.*

Beacon's Perch is an outpost between the Northern and Southern Shiverpeaks.

### Graggult’s Keep

Graggult's Keep is a small area in the Deldrimor Bowl that is surrounded by Centaurs.

## Frost Gate

*The Frost Gate was built by the Deldrimor Dwarves as a way to protect their homes from invaders coming through Borlis Pass. When civil war broke out, the gate fell into the hands of the Stone Summit, a xenophobic group of Dwarven renegades who are trying to overthrow King Jalis Ironhammer. Now, no one gets through the pass unless the Summit allows it.*

The Frost Gate is a mission outpost and is the last Deldrimor outpost on the way to a gigantic gate built to regulate passage between the western and eastern Shiverpeaks. The outpost is commanded by Brechnar Ironhammer, brother to King Jalis Ironhammer.

The Frost Gate is a huge fortified gate in the Northern Shiverpeaks that is guarded by the Stone Summit to prevent travel to and from Kryta or the Southern Shiverpeaks.

## Griffon’s Mouth

The Griffon's Mouth refers to a small cave system with dead end paths that connects the Northern Shiverpeaks to the borders of Kryta. The way is not without its dangers as Snow Ettins call this place home.

## Iron HOrse Mine

The Iron Horse Mine is large area to the northwest of Yak's Bend that houses a productive Stone Summit mine. It likely drew its name from the large amount of mining machinery placed in the mine. The Stone Summit dwarves patrol only a short distance from their mine entrances, leaving the Snow Ettins still roaming along the east and the Frostfire Dryders in the west.

## Traveler’s Vale

Traveler's Vale is most frequently traversed path in the Northern Shiverpeaks as one attempts to cross the mountainous region. It is currently patrolled by the Stone Summit who are eager to drive off all non-Dwarves from the mountain.

### Shiverpeak Arena

*In the icy Shiverpeaks, fighting gladiator-style is the best way for heroes to stay warm while sharpening their reflexes and earning the respect and admiration of their peers and the public. The Shiverpeak Arena is one of two in this frozen mountain range.*

### Yak’s Bend

*So called because of the numerous yak herds that rove throughout the area, Yak's Bend is the last refuge for travelers who are about to undertake the rough passage through the Shiverpeaks. Because of its lower altitude, the weather here is somewhat less harsh, providing a place to rest, regroup, and re-equip.*

Yak's Bend is a village in the Northern Shiverpeaks.

-----------------

# Southern Shiverpeaks

The Southern Shiverpeaks is, as the name implies, southern portion of the Shiverpeak Mountains and home to the capital of the Dwarves. In contrast to the Northern Shiverpeaks, this segment of the mountain range is considerably harsher. All kinds of wildlife, such as Tundra Giants, Frost Wurms, Ice Imps, Blessed Griffons, and Mountain Trolls, roam the snowy tundra, and, in addition to Deldrimor and the Stone Summit, it is currently occupied by other warring factions: the Avicara Tengu, White Mantle, Shining Blade, and Mursaat. The northern and southern areas are connected by several long, winding, and treacherous valleys, heavily populated with dangerous indigenous creatures.

## Dreadnought’s Drift

Dreadnought's Drift is the name given to the small, relatively open bottleneck between Lornar's Pass and Snake Dance. The area is densely populated with large groups of giants and Stone Summit, but the true terror of this area is Maw the Mountain Heart, who makes its lair here along the eastern cliff faces. Although it seems an unlikely place, a statue of Dwayna can be found here, visible on the map as a pale ring along the southern cliff face.

## Droknar’s Forge

This location is only accessible after completing Hell's Precipice, the final mission in Guild Wars Prophecies. In this explorable area, players completing the mission for the first time can receive a Deldrimor Talisman. This can then be used to trade for unique items.

*Long ago, when the tribes of Deldrimor were united under one banner, Droknar's Forge was the seat of the mighty Dwarven nation's power. Named for one of its most beloved kings, the Forge has never once been taken by an enemy nation.*

Droknar's Forge is the town for the Shiverpeak Mountains region of Tyria.

### Glint’s Shrine

Glint's shrine is a circular shrine made out of dark blue crystalline materials. It is maintained by the Brotherhood of the Dragon dedicated to the Dragon prophet Glint. Kneeling within the shrine will summon the Vision of Glint.

## Frozen Forest

The name Frozen Forest is a bit of a misnomer, since there aren't a lot of trees here, frozen or otherwise. Dwarf mines, on the other hand, are plentiful, as are the Stone Summit Dwarves and Avicara Tengu that populate most of the Southern Shiverpeaks.

## Grenth’s Footprint

Grenth's Footprint is a maze of canyons and cliffs in the Southern Shiverpeaks. The area was once considered sacred to the Deldrimor, but has since been claimed by the Stone Summit and stripped for metal, turned into mines - the most notable of them being Sorrow's Furnace at the very base of the canyons. A few Deldrimor soldiers can be found in the more remote areas, scouting the terrain and searching for their lost brethren.

### Deldrimor War Camp

*A dozen years ago, two Ascalon explorers, Marshall Whitman and Tasca, planted a flag in the ground and declared this thin patch of the ground to be their base camp. Those days of peaceful exploration are now gone, replaced by ballistae, Deldrimor soldiers, and Dolyaks perched on the precipice of Grenth's Footprint.*

The Deldrimor War Camp is an outpost in the Southern Shiverpeaks.

## Ice Caves of Sorrow

*The area surrounding this Dwarven city is dotted with numerous icy caverns that, when the wind whips through them, make a mournful sound reminiscent of a crying woman. Waterways, frozen solid year round, wind through the land here, but the resourceful Dwarves have found a way to navigate them by building large ships that skate atop the ice.*

## Ice Dome

The Icedome is a small area between Talus Chute and the Frozen Forest. The Stone Summit maintain a heavy presence here.

## Ice Floe

The Ice Floe is a snowy and mountainous terrain through which a frozen river cuts across the northwest. The Mursaat maintain patrols throughout this area, although the southern areas are largely under the control of a large number of Ice Imps.

### Marhan’s Grotto

Marhan's Grotto is an outpost to the south of Ice Floe. Its a small grotto where the ground is covered in ice, which causes players to move slowly due to the icy ground effect. Marhan's Grotto is home to one of Prophecies' prestige armourers, Karl.

*Once, Dwarves from all over the Shiverpeaks made the trek here to barter with Marhan the Mighty, a weaponsmith who was reputed for making the best axes in all the land. After he passed into the Great Forge, this grotto was named in his honor.*






## Iron Mines of MOladune

*Centuries ago the city of Moladune is said to have lain here in the southern Shiverpeak Mountains. A shining palace of ice and stone, legends say that it stood for thousands of years, then fell one bright dawn in a single earthshaking crash, leaving behind no sign of its inhabitants. Today, the mines are the only sign that the city might once have been more than myth.*

Iron Mines of Moladune is a mission outpost. It is a small dwarven settlement with a corral for Dolyaks in the center, and dwarven buildings around the perimeter.

## Lornar’s Pass

Those wishing to travel from Beacon's Perch to Droknar's Forge must brave the treacherous Lornar's Pass. This cold, remote mountain pass is home to several tribes of Avicara Tengu, Grawl, and Trolls, but the real danger to travelers are the giant Frost Wurms that attack without warning in the narrow passes. A statue of Grenth stands at the southern end of Lornar's Pass, from which players can gain access to the Underworld.

### Temple of Grenth

The Temple of Grenth is located in the south-eastern portion of Lornar's Pass. It is built within several cliffs with a statue of Grenth in the deepest part of it, and the temple has a unique kind of structure as the entrance.

## Mineral Springs

Mineral Springs is an area in the Shiverpeaks. Its nearest outpost is The Granite Citadel, although it is not directly adjacent to it. Mineral springs has one main path which runs in a loop around the area. It is not possible to cut across the loop and the path must be followed all the way round. There are 6 Avicara boss spawns along the path, three of which have elites only obtainable from this area. To the south east there is a cave guarded by Ice Imps, Siege Ice Golems and Nightmares, including the Phantom Boss Ice Beast. This cave includes a statue of Lyssa and opens up to a lake vista where the Seer is available to infuse armor. Further to the east is a smaller cave where (rarely) Maw the Mountain Heart can be found.

### Temple of Lyssa

The ancient temple of Lyssa lies in a cave located in the north east of Mineral Springs and contains a statue of Lyssa and two large diagonal dishes which pulsate with a metallic hum. Behind the cave, there is an Ice Beast and a Seer which will allow you to infuse a set of armor. 

There are large mobs of Ice Imps inside the cave. These are the only creatures known to drop the Icy Dragon Sword.

## Snake Dance

### Camp Rankor

Camp Rankor is a small, Stone Summit controlled outpost nestled between explorable areas Snake Dance and Talus Chute.

*Named after the Stone Summit Dwarf Rankor Ironwill who was known for his extreme intolerance of other races, Camp Rankor had its immoral beginnings as a slave labor camp. Although it is still used to house some of its slaves, the Summit use it largely as a staging area for launching raids against the Deldrimor Dwarves.*

## Sorrow’s Furnace

Sorrow's Furnace is the largest mine of the Stone Summit Dwarves, resting at the base of Grenth's Footprint. The land surrounding Sorrow's Furnace was once sacred for the Deldrimor Dwarves until it was stripped by the Stone Summit for the metals in the mountain, and turned into a series of mines with Sorrow's Furnace at the base. Within Sorrow's Furnace itself is a series of underground mining operations as well as a multitude of ruins. Within the northern portions of Sorrow's Furnace, a huge crevice opens into the surface in the area known as The Gap, allowing the cold mountain air and snow to met with the burning heat of the furnaces. In the southern portions lie a series of tunnels covered in vegetation, not yet mined and littered with the old ruins - including The Stone Basilica. 

In the heart of the furnace lies the Iron Forgeman, a large cyclopean golem being constructed to both replace the need of the Stone Summit's Dredge Slaves as well as become a weapon to use in the war against Deldrimor.

### Darkhaven

Darkhaven is the southernmost portion of Sorrow's Furnace. It is full of vegetation and littered with old, collapsing ruins. Many of the Dredge can be found here, including the revolutionary leader Molachev.

### Sorrow’s Belly

Sorrow's Belly lies within the center of Sorrow's Furnace. It is a vast cavernous area , with a gorge in the center that has various wooden bridges spanning over it.

### The Gap

The Gap is a large canyon inside of Sorrow's Furnace. The Gap encompasses much of the north eastern region of the furnace, forming an arc, which splits Sorrow's Furnace from old ruins being excavated. On the eastern edge, there is a large mechanical bridge that can be maneuvered up and down, connecting the Gap to the entrances of the chambers containing the Iron Forgeman. On the northern edge of the Gap are a series of crushers, used to crush raw ore into Ore Ingots. Above the Gap is an open ceiling to the outside, letting in the cold snow and air to contrast with the burning heat of the furnaces deeper in the mine. 

The quests Cold One and Summit Slaves lead players there.

### The Iron Arch

The Iron Arch is one of the main gates dividing the inside of Sorrow's Furnace into sections. It is part of a dark cave southeast of Sorrow's Belly that features one of the entrances into area containing the Iron Forgeman. It is guarded by three Furnace Guardians.

### The Stone Basilica

The Stone Basilica is the site of ancient Dwarven ruins deep inside Sorrow's Furnace. The Basilica is a towering structure of stairs, pillars and arches that can be found through the right most (south) door upon entering the Furnace

## Spearhead Peak

Spearhead Peak is an area in the Southern Shiverpeaks. Its high, narrow passes lead to some of the more dangerous places in the mountains.

### Copperhammer Mines

This is a small outpost in the center of the Southern Shiverpeaks, found to the northeast of Droknar's Forge.

*Through an unfortunate twist of heritage, Orto Copperhammer shared ownership of these mines with a cousin, Brag, a Stone Summit warlord. When Brag learned that Ortho[sic] had trade agreements with the human settlements in the foothills, he led a raid on the mines to punish his cousin. Today this area serves as an outpost for adventurers on their way to the Frozen Forest.*

### The Granite Citadel

*Located between the Stone Summit hotbeds Tasca's Demise and Spearhead Peak, the Granite Citadel is a grand fortress held by the Deldrimor Dwarves. A safe harbor in a deadly ocean of hostility, the outpost here sells relief to weary adventurers.*

The Granite Citadel is one of the only two outposts in the Prophecies campaign where prestige armor can be crafted, the other being Marhan's Grotto.

## Talus Chute

Talus Chute is a wide area that lies to the northwest of Droknar's Forge. Many denizens commonly encountered in the Shiverpeaks can all be found here.

## Tasca’s Demise

Tasca's Demise is a small area in the Southern Shiverpeaks packed with Stone Summit. Most notably, as soon as you come out of Granite Citadel there is a set of three peaks. There are Stone Summit hiding behind all of them and will popup as soon as you approach.

## Thunderhead Keep

*Within the last generation, Thunderhead Keep has become the capital of the Deldrimor nation. Since the Stone Summit uprising, it has served double duty as both the royal court to King Jalis Ironhammer and as the last line of defense for the good Dwarves of Deldrimor.*

Thunderhead Keep is a mission outpost. It is the fortress-like capital city of the Deldrimor Dwarves.

## Witman’s Folly

Witman's Folly is a relatively small area that is made up snowy terrain and ice blocks that borders a frozen sea to the south. The Deldrimor Dwarves maintain a port to the southwest for their ice ships. The western half of this area has dense populations of Grawl while the seemingly empty eastern areas are in truth hiding many Nightmare groups.

### Port Sledge

*This bustling port supplies the Dwarves with much of their goods and supplies. The dockworkers are kept busy with a constant flow of ships coming and going, and the market is always filled with exotic and practical wares. The cold temperatures, heavy snowfall, and frozen waters make no difference to the hearty Dwarves, but travelers are wise to bring heavy coats and plenty of warm blankets.*

Port Sledge is a small, tranquil outpost to the southeast of Droknar's Forge, the two are separated by Witman's Folly. It's a small snowy outpost that serves as a port. Its most prominent feature is the long bridge leading to Witman's Folly.

# Far Shiverpeaks

The Far Shiverpeaks is the northernmost section of the Shiverpeak Mountains that, until 1078 AE and the Destroyer threat, was unexplored and unknown to most Tyrians. It is the home of the individualistic Norn, the gigantic Jotun, and the Centaurs of the Shiverpeaks, the Modniir.

## Bjora Marches

The northeastern corner of the Far Shiverpeaks, sloping down towards the southeast, where it connects with the Charr Homelands.

### Darkrime Delves

*A vast series of caves, called the Darkrime Delves by the local Norn, leads into the depths of the northern mountains in Bjora Marches. Home to snow jotun, the caves provide natural defenses for the ferocious (yet not terribly clever) beasts. We came upon two hunters, Kolgrim and Einarr, in the middle of an argument over which of them had the right to enter the Delves and kill the new jotun leader. The matter was a point of both honor and glory, as the defeat of such a powerful beast would certainly immortalize the victor. There seemed no end in sight to their bitter discussion, so on a lark, they allowed us to enter the caves first. The hunt was long and arduous, but in the end, the incredulous Norn were amazed by our success. Our impressive victory greatly increased our reputation.*

### Gursteig’s Cavern

Gursteig's Cavern is a large cave in the southern portion of Bjora Marches. It is home to the infamous Lissah the Packleader and her fellow wolves.

### Jora’s Homestead

Jora's homestead is located in the eastern center portion of Bjora Marches and is the homestead of Jora's clan. It was overrun by Charr while Jora was hunting the Nornbear, but later reclaimed during Blood Washes Blood.

### Shrine of the Bear Spirit

The Shrine of the Bear Spirit is found in Bjora Marches dedicated to the Bear Spirit. In the shrine's center is a ghostly image of the bear spirit. By talking to it, you can obtain the skill Ursan Aura.

### Volsung’s Stead

Volsung's Stead was established by Volsung Irongut.

## Drakkar Lake

This area is named after the large frozen lake in the middle, a place the Norn shun due to a foreboding sense of dark magic. To the north are icy caverns that house a shrine to the spirit of Wolf. The south are where tribes of Modniir centaurs roam.

### Drakkar

Drakkar is one of many dormant champions of the Elder Ice Dragon Jormag that is trapped within the ice of Drakkar Lake. While it is trapped within the ice, it is still capable of utilizing its powers to "whisper" Jormag's influence and magical energy into those nearby. Drakkar was what turned Svanir into the Nornbear and caused Jora to lose her Norn ability to "become the bear."

### Rabbit Hole

At the southeastern corner of Drakkar Lake your party will see a Rabbit. As you approach, the Rabbit will run down a circular warren with a beautiful pool and tree at the bottom. When the rabbit arrives at the bottom, it will come to a stop. Anyone approaching the creature will spawn several other rabbits and all of them will turn hostile. Worse, the hostile Nulfastu appears with dozens of other Vaettirs, swarming the whole area. This often results in a wipe. 

However, it can sometimes be avoided by not following the Rabbit and, instead, going counterclockwise along the outer edge of the glade until reaching the north side. From this position, Nulfastu can be attacked directly before it is able to raise the Vaettirs. Once Nulfastu has been taken care of, the rest of the rabbits can be killed or simply ignored. When vanquishing, all spawned creatures must be slain, while all creatures that did not appear do not have to be killed. 

The rabbit hole has a number of unusual features, likely due to the influence of Nulfastu, a corrupt nature spirit: 

·        It is filled with thick fog.

·        It has snow-covered deciduous trees, unlike the surrounding area, which has conifers.

·        The stump and adjacent stones are inscribed with spiral designs, and are surrounded by rising sparkles.

·        The water glows blue.

·        There are floating discs of ice along the outer edge.

·        There are numerous flowers blossoming around the area.

·        There is a 1 in 100 chance Nulfastu and the vaettirs will not spawn, instead only bunnies will spawn in their place.

There are several allusions to naively following a trail into the unknown: 

·        In Lewis Carroll's 1865 publication, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice followed a white rabbit down a hole, leading her into a wonderland. 

·        The "killer rabbit" in the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail — all who ventured into its cave were never seen again.

### Sepulchre of Dragrimmar

*Remlok, a lone Dwarven outrunner, waited near the entrance to a hidden sepulchre tucked away in the northern mountains. He wished to procure the Anvil of Dragrimmar, a Dwarven artifact from a bygone age. The anvil was guarded by ancient traps and an ice elemental of immense size and power. Having this charismatic Dwarf on our side could only help our cause, so we braved the pitfalls and escorted him into the sepulchre.*

### Shrine of the Wolf Spirit

The Shrine of the Wolf Spirit is found in Drakkar Lake dedicated to the Wolf Spirit. In the shrine's center is a ghostly image of the wolf spirit. By talking to it, you can obtain the Volfen Blessing.

### Sifhalla

*Sif Shadowhunter refused to battle for an encampment held by other Norn, instead building her own hearthstead and defending it so fiercely that some call it "Bear Mother's Cave" in tribute to her strength and glory. Others of similar attitude have put up hides here, describing notorious foes they plan to hunt, or daring others to track them down.*

Sifhalla resides to the north of Drakkar Lake. Noteworthy are the various Notorious Foe banners, giving general locations and tactics of various bosses the Norn are hunting.

## Ice Cliff Chasms

This is the first explorable area players will visit in the Far Shiverpeaks, and is the site of the mysterious tower, known as the Eye of the North.

### Boreal Station

*The Norn still refer to Boreal Station as Feodor's Hearthstead, even though Feodor is long gone. The Asura emerged from beneath this quiet hunter's home and appropriated it for their own needs, adding a node to their network of gates and transforming the stead into a supply waystation. It is muttered among the Norn that old Feodor is alive somewhere deep beneath his home, lost in Asura lands, protesting the invasion with a hammer and shield.*

Before the fall of the Central Transfer Chamber, Boreal Station served as a recent addition the Asura's secondary gate network, carved as a supply depot and way station in the Norn lands. The Norn themselves have mostly abandoned the area, though they sometimes use it as a hunting camp. Some Norn say that Feodor's spirit haunts the area, while others say he is still alive, lost in the maze of magical portals of the Asura gate system.

### Eye of the North

*The origin of the Eye of the North is so ancient it has been lost to even the wisest skaald, the cultural storytellers of the Norn. Currently, the massive structure has become a base of operations for a group of Ascalonian expatriates known as the Ebon Vanguard, who plan and execute raids against the Charr from within the safety of its walls.*

The Eye of the North is a tower in the Far Shiverpeaks. The structure is not of Dwarven, Asuran, or human in construction, although it resembles the architecture of Arah and other godly sites. The Norn who settled the Far Shiverpeaks were the first to "discover" the Eye; they sensed something unnatural about its construction, and assiduously avoided it. In recent years, the Ebon Vanguard of the Ascalon Army settled within the tower and made it their main stronghold in the north. 

The Eye is built on a perpetually frozen alpine lake, with a single, easily defended entrance that leads into a wide circular chamber. To the rear of the Eye is a separate chamber, the Hall of Monuments, which holds a Scrying Pool within, though it remained dormant to the Ebon Vanguard's attempt to use it.

### Gwen’s Garden

Gwen's garden is nestled in a corner behind the Eye of the North. As the name implies, it is a small garden maintained by Gwen. Here she grows Red Iris Flowers, among other things.

### Hall of Monuments

*Heroes are born in the crucible of conflict and tempered in the flames of battle. Their deeds shine throughout history as a beacon of hope to those who must rise to defend the world in ages to come, becoming part of the legend of the land. The legends forged within Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall, and the Eye of the North will not be forgotten in the future world of Guild Wars 2.* 

*Your deeds from the original Guild Wars campaigns will be commemorated in the Eye of the North expansion in your Hall of Monuments. The Hall of Monuments will reflect the achievements you earn in Eye of the North as well as those earned in Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall. You will even be able to show off your hall to friends. Then, when Guild Wars 2 arrives, each of these monuments will correspond to special features your Guild Wars 2 characters can "inherit" from your own legendary past, giving you access to exclusive titles, companions , weapons, attire, and miniatures. These inherited items are unique: there is no other way within Guild Wars 2 to acquire them.*

The Hall of Monuments is an explorable area that commemorates acquisitions and accomplishments of a character and/or an account. Available only to accounts that are linked to Eye of the North, it is the only area in the game that is personalized to the party leader. Five distinct monuments allow players to show off certain weapons, all miniatures, most heroes and some pets, various prestige armor, and player titles. The hall also serves to kickoff key quests in Eye of the North and for dialogue and quests related to Guild Wars Beyond. 

More importantly for many players, filling one's Hall of Monuments is the only way to unlock a number of Guild Wars 2 bonus items and titles.

### Ice Column Statue

The ice column statue is a giant pillar in the northeastern corner of the Ice Cliff Chasms that has a reptilian creature frozen within it. The area is patrolled by ice elementals.

## Jaga Moraine

Jaga Moraine is the northernmost accessible part of the Far Shiverpeaks.

### Bottomless Pit

*In memory of the Norn who ventured into the bottomless pit to discover if it leads to the other side of the world:*

·        *Askel Cliffdiver*

·        *Gunolf the Mountain*

·        *Hardi Jotuncrusher*

·        *May they find glory and honor in the Mists should they never return.*

The bottomless pit is a massive hole located in the very northeastern corner of Jaga Moraine, right next to where Ssissth the Leviathan or Edielh Shockhunter spawns.

The hole and the missing Norn is a reference to A Journey to the Center of the Earth where Otto (Professor Lidenbrock), Axel, and Hans travel to the center of the Earth through a volcano on Iceland.

### Egil’s Perch

*Here stands the home of Egil Fireteller, twelve-time Alemoot champion, all time record holder in the ale slog, and master storyteller of great Norn legends.*

Egil's Perch is the home of Egil Fireteller. It is located near the center of Jaga Moraine, near the areas where Frost Wurms can be found.

### Frostmaw’s Burrows

*Outside Frostmaw's Burrows, a Norn storyteller once regaled listeners with tales of a great wurm named Frostmaw that burrowed through the mountains. According to the tale, the wurm could not be killed. Many great warriors had fallen while attempting to slay the beast. Frostmaw and its brood, it seems, were distant cousins to the sand, chaos, and desert wurms. Ice wurms have a thick blubber layer beneath their tough skin, which insulates them from the frigid temperatures of the Shiverpeaks. It also makes them all but impervious to harm, whether it's from phyical or magical means. Unfazed by the warnings, we ventured into the wurm's lair to test our steel and skills against these formidable opponents.*

### Haunted Homestead

The Haunted homestead is an abandoned Norn settlement located in the south-eastern portion of Jaga Moraine. The Sacred Altar resides within this village that was overrun with hostile spirits.

### Sacred Altar

The Sacred Altar is the shrine used to summon the Bear Spirit. It is located within the Vaettir-infested haunted homestead.

## Norrhart Domains

Norrhart Domains is an area of the Far Shiverpeaks populated by Jotun, Modniir, Mandragors and Elementals.

### Fenrir’s Den

Fenrir's den is a cave in Norrhart Domains where Fenrir and several other Kveldulf make their home.

### Gunnar’s Hold

Gunnar's Hold is the main Norn settlement, named after Gunnar Poundfist.

*The armorer, Gunnar Poundfist, claims current ownership over this massive hearthstead, the longest-occupied of all Norn settlements. The great hold has changed names numerous times over the years, controlled and claimed by many powerful Norn. Gunnar is a notable smith, a profession that earns great respect within the Norn community; enough so that Poundfist's claim on Gunnar's Hold has stood for quite some time, as most other Norn are wary of losing his good will.*

### Jotun Arena

The Jotun arena is located in the north-western portion of Norrhart Domains. Six Jotun encircle two Jotun warriors dueling each other; you can safely watch the contest from an overlook.

## Polymock Glacier

Polymock Glacier is an area where Polymock matches take place. You are brought here when you challenge certain NPCs to a Polymock match.

## Varajar Fells

In the southwest corner of the Far Shiverpeaks, Varajar Fells connects Norn lands to Asuran lands.

### Olafstead

*Home of Olaf Olafson, the seventh Olaf in his family line, this squat, hilltop fort overlooks Varajar Fells. The grass-covered keep is a haven for Norn hunters to rest between battles and tell tales by the fireside. Olaf is also the reigning champion of Great Norn Alemoot, and his notoriety draws younger Norn to his fireside to hear stories of his mighty battles.*

### Raven’s Point

*Raven's Point, home of the Shrine of the Raven, is protected by the family of our good friend, Olaf. Communing at the shrine grants adventurers the powers of the raven spirit. King Jalis, thankful for Olaf's hospitality when the Deldrimor Dwarves first arrived in the Far Shiverpeaks, sent a group of Dwarves and a clever Asura to protect the hallowed place from Destroyers. After seeing firsthand the devastation these creatures had wrought, we didn't think twice about coming to their aid.*

### Varajar Stone Circle

A stone circle is located on the east-central side of Varajar Fells has a small enclosed section that is darkened by shadows. This location is tied closely to the Mists and during Wintersday, the boundary between Tyria and the Underworld is weakest here. The spirits of the dead also seem drawn here.

------------

# Tarnished Coast

Previously uninhabited, the Tarnished Coast is the coast of the Maguuma Jungle. It is where the Asura now reside, forced from the Depths of Tyria by the Destroyers. It currently acts as their staging ground for their stand against the Great Destroyer. It is full of ruins that have been renovated by the Asura, and is home to ground that is brimming with magical energies, and in turn levitates. Some of this magic is harnessed for the Golems. 

The architecture of the Tarnished Coast is a combination of preexisting architecture with Asuran modifications. It is unknown which race or civilization built the architecture, but one thing is for sure, there was once a civilization situated in the Tarnished Coast before the Asura arrived there.

## Arbor Bay

Arbor Bay is an explorable area on the east side of the Tarnished Coast. The krait are spread out across its eastern hills and waterways, while simians make their home in the ancient ruins in the northwest section. Patrols of Wind Riders circle the lake in the southwest. Ventari can be found on a small island near the center of the lake; his sanctuary is also home to the Pale Tree from which the firstborn sylvari will eventually arise.

### Arbor Bay Ruins

"Arbor Bay ruins" refers to the sunken pyramid and the surrounding ruins within a large cavern in northern Arbor Bay. These structures share the same design as both Rata Sum and other Tarnished Coast ruins as well as the Central Transfer Chamber. The Asura decide to settle here after clearing it from threatening Destroyers and its inhabitants of local wildlife.

### Shards of Orr

*An ancient ghost recounted a haunting tale of piracy and betrayal. Following her defeat during the Second Great Corsair War, the corsair leader Lady Glaive sailed the tattered remnants of her fleet north to the Tarnished Coast. There, she parlayed a deal with King Zoran of Orr, father to King Reza, to gain amnesty for her forces within the caverns we now call the Shards of Orr. Unbeknownst to Lady Glaive, one of her own lieutenants, a young corsair named Fendi, made his own deal with the king's adviser. Fendi betrayed his leader and his crew. Glaive escaped, but most of the crew were slain. Their spirits remain enslaved by the betrayals of the past. Soon afterward, the dark pact Fendi made with the adviser showed its true nature. Fendi joined the ranks of the undead, forced for all eternity to draw his power from the souls of those trapped with him.*

The Shards of Orr was originally an armory and storehouse for Orr, before being turned into a refuge for the Queen of Fools crew. After Fendi Nin's betrayal, Glaive escaped, but her ultimate fate remains unknown, and she had to leave the bulk of her crew behind. 

Magical energies washed the Tarnished Coast shores after the Cataclysm, making already deadly monsters more powerful from these energies. These energies attracted the Asura as well, who established a secondary Asura Gate to Sparkfly Swamp within the Shards.

### Ventari’s Sanctuary

Ventari's sanctuary is a safe haven founded by Ventari after the constant combat he observed among his people in Kryta. He is joined by others looking to find a safe home, isolated from the wars of humans and centaurs. Along with Ronan, and after the human's death, Ventari planted, raised and nurtured the Pale Tree.

### Vlox’s Falls

*One of the northeastern Asuran communities, this settlement is dominated by magnificent falls that coats every surface with a fine mist. The local gate provides access to the Vloxen Excavations, an extensive mining operation recently overrun by exiled Stone Summit Dwarves.*

When the opportunist Asura were forced to the surface, they quickly set about marshaling their meager resources and claiming new ones. Among those existing resources was a functioning secondary gate in the northeastern Tarnished Coast, connecting to extensive caverns. An eccentric Asura named Vlox claimed the Tarnished Coast end of the gate and gave his name to both the outpost and the unexplored depths beyond the gate. However, before the Asura could establish themselves within the excavations, the Asura were overrun and forced out by the exiled Stone Summit and their enslaved Dredge.

## Alcazia Tangle

Alcazia Tangle is found at the southern part of the Tarnished Coast. Dinosaurs roam the northern zone, while Simians and Quetzal Tengu are found in the southern reaches.

### Renk’s Laboratory

Renk's laboratory is where Renk does his research since the asura have approached the surface and lived in the Tarnished Coast.

### Tarnished Haven

In Tarnished Haven you will find Shing Jea Sherman, an NPC that will shout a quote relating to a random title of any player standing near him.

*Founded by exiles from Kryta, this settlement is a common destination for political refugees. Those who find themselves "on the outs" with the current ruling faction in Lion's Arch come here to hide from the political upheaval rampant within the Krytan state. As a result, the haven's inhabitants are a combination of expatriates, agents, spies, and refugees.*

## Magus Stones

Magus Stones is the explorable area south and west of Rata Sum. It is populated by Krait and Hylek to the east and west respectively, with deadly spiders roaming the southeast.

### Arachni’s Haunt

*Arachni's Haunt is the lair of a mighty spider and her brood of matriarchs. The web-strewn caverns also contain potent energy veins the Asura tap to fuel their creations. Commander Hixx and his battle krewe were station [sic] here to protect this resource, and they're still locked in an unending battle against the matriarchs. These creatures spin webs that no normal fire can burn through. In response to this sticky development, Mamp developed a super-heated staff capable of burning through the silk and setting the matriarch's massive egg sacs ablaze. Fragments of destroyed young can still be found littered amongst the corpses of Hixx's shattered patrol. Destroying the egg sacs, it seems, is a sure way to enrage the spider matriarchs, as well as Arachni herself.*

### Oola’s Lab

*Oola, a reclusive Asura whose magical skills and achievements have made her a nearly legendary figure, once resided at the bottom of a labyrinthine system of caverns. Disdaining polite society, she sequestered herself in a hidden laboratory to continue her work in peace and quiet. When her fellow Asura needed her expertise in the battle against the Destroyers, Oola rejoined them. With no one left to maintain the golems that once guarded the lab, her creations went berserk. The only way to restore order was by tracking down the TPS regulator, the ultimate source of these major malfunctions.*

Oola's Lab, also referred to as Oola's Workshop, is the large underground laboratory complex belonging to Oola. The main lab itself resides behind a series of caverns full of various defensive mechanisms and traps. Within the largest room of the lab, several replications of the Iron Forgeman, all smaller than the original, can be found in various stages of development. The lab's defense systems are ran by the total protection security regulator golem.

### Rata Sum

*The hub of Asuran activity on the surface world, Rata Sum was quickly and magically erected when the race arrived from their native underground homes. Geomystic generators dot the area, providing free power to the town. Some find the atmosphere within the town uncomfortable, saying you can literally feel the Energy being sucked from the air, but the Asura vow this enchanted technology is "perfectly safe".*

Rata Sum is the above-ground center of Asuran activity in the Tarnished Coast.

## Polymock Coliseum

Polymock Coliseum is an area where Polymock matches take place. You are brought here when you challenge certain NPCs to a Polymock match.

## Riven Earth

Riven Earth is an explorable area along the Tarnished Coast. Its name derives from the deep river chasm that was carved by the mighty waterfall in the southeast, and continuing its course towards the northwest. The Maguuma Jungle lies further to the north, separated by mountain ranges and dense forests that have not yet been explored. A variety of creatures can be found here, with the various species of Dinosaurs prowling the southern half (including a den of Raptors), and large spiders making their nests in the southwest and the cliffs to the north. Simians are also found in abundant numbers along the mountain trails and to the north. The Asura have set up the golem foundry just northeast of Rata Sum, and they also have a camp in southwest.

### Destroyer Hive

This Destroyer Hive is one of the places where the Destroyer have breached the surface in the Tarnished Coast. It is an area where new Destroyers are formed.

### G.O.L.E.M. Site

The G.O.L.E.M. site is a large area where Golems designed to fight Destroyers are created by Asura. When activated, multiple incomplete rings circle around its center, which has a platform leading there. There are two Golem Kilns which are larger Golems used to forge combat-ready Golems.

### Raptor Cave

The raptor cave is a den of young Raptors and their broodmother located in Riven Earth, just south of Rata Sum.

### Riven Earth Falls

"Riven Earth falls" refers to the large waterfall on the eastern edge of Riven Earth. At the top of the waterfall are large faces carved out of the cliffs.

## Sparkfly Swamp

Sparkfly Swamp is an explorable area west of the Southern Shiverpeaks. It's still considered part of the Tarnished Coast.

### Bloodstone Caves

*Many adventurers have told legends of the Bloodstones, and a few brave souls claim to have seen them. Even after hearing these stories, standing in the presence of such power is still quite... intoxicating. A brilliant Asuran researcher named Gadd assisted us in our search for another Bloodstone. With our help, the Asura would have to decipher a series of inscriptions placed by the guardians... odd creatures called inscribed ettins... before we could reach the legendary relic. The guardians were busy shoring up their defenses, and our allies in the Shining Blade had taken an interest in their activities. Their scouts, always on the lookout for enchanted weaponry to use in their struggle against the White Mantle, noticed the ettins returning to this place repeatedly, where they harvested some sort of magical essences. Bartholos believed they could be weaponized for the Shining Blade's war effort.*

The Bloodstone Caves extend into the side of the Shiverpeak Mountains and contain ruins with inscriptions similar to those found on two of the Bloodstones. The bloodstone found in the deepest level of this dungeon, the Shiverpeak Bloodstone, was perhaps where the White Mantle intended to sacrifice Evennia and Saidra.

### Bogroot Growths

*Bogroot Growths, a complex of caverns just outside Sparkfly Swamp, is a war zone. The caverns are home to two frogmen tribes, the Ophil and the Gokir. The habitats of these tribes collided due to some... unfortunate miscalculations... during an Asuran digging expedition, forcing the antagonistic creatures uncomfortably close to each other. Both groups now vie for dominance, with each side supported by one of two Asuran observers. We were asked to choose a side in this inter-clan war and bring an end to the bloodshed... for the sake of progress, of course.*

### Gadd’s Encampment

Gadd's Encampment is an outpost situated west of the Shiverpeaks on the eastern coastline of the Sea of Sorrows adjacent to Sparkfly Swamp.

*This ramshackle and temporary collection of buildings is the base of the Asuran elementalist, Gadd, who has been investigating the nature of a nearby Bloodstone. Because Gadd cares little for comfort, rest, or visitors, the settlement is quite spartan and harsh, with little in the way of amenities, or even permanent structures.*

## Vloxen Excavations

*Sorrow's Furnace was not the only place where the evil Stone Summit had pressed the Dredge into forced labor. Deep within the Vloxen Excavations, Dredge toiled away under the watchful eye of their Stone Summit taskmasters. On the surface, this dig appeared as yet another ore mining operation, but clues hinted that the Stone Summit had uncovered unspeakable horrors. They were using slaves to excavate this ancient evil. With the help of some escapees, we confronted this horrific presence and stopped the Stone Summit's wicked plans.*

# Woodland Cascades

Woodland Cascades is a forested area that lies north of Kryta.

The only explorable part of the Woodland Cascades is Verdant Cascades.

## Verdant Cascades

The Verdant Cascades, part of the Woodland Cascades north of Kryta, draws its name from the lush flora, flowing waters, and cascading falls all around it, attracting even Jotun from the Shiverpeak Mountains to its northeastern cliffs. The Riders claim the east, the Skelk infest the north, and the Quetzal Tengu have settled in the southwestern corner.

### Quetzal Village

The Quetzal village is an unnamed village in the southwest corner of Verdant Cascades. It is deep within Quetzal territory that's marked by Notice to Trespassers signposts and resides near a waterfall and is filled with various Quetzal Tengu, including Petraj the Evasive.

### Slaver’s Exile

*Filled with refugees from abroad, Slaver's [sic] Exile is a dangerous place, indeed. The death of the Great Destroyer left a power vacuum, prompting a Stone Summit Hierophant to step forward in the hopes of taking control. A group of short-sighted Norn anxiously await the inevitable conflict to satisfy their bloodlust.*

Slavers' Exile is Guild Wars' sole elite dungeon. The entrance is located in the southeastern corner of Verdant Cascades, and the dungeon can only be entered by teams that have at least one person who has completed A Time For Heroes.

### Umbral Grotto

*Tucked between the dark granite of the mountain fastness, the Umbral Grotto is a lurking place for those who wish to keep their activities shrouded in shadow. The caverns beneath are overrun with Stone Summit Dwarves from the southern Shiverpeaks, making the grotto a dangerous place to wander.*

------

# Cantha

Cantha is a continent in the world of Tyria that was first introduced in Guild Wars Factions. It is located to the southwest of the continents of Tyria and Elona. The northern coastline of Cantha is the earliest known location of human settlements, dating back to the late pre-imperial era, 276 years before the beginning of the Canthan calendar, and predating the earliest known human presence in Tyria and Elona by 581 years.

Cantha and the surrounding islands can be divided into four major regions: 

·        Shing Jea Island: A large island off the west coast of the continent that has been declared an imperial national park, it is a farmland that produces the food for the entire Empire and is the home of the Shing Jea Monastery; a haven for those who are gifted and have no noble title. Aspiring students from throughout all Cantha are trained within this institution's secluded walls by the Empire of the Dragon's greatest Masters. The island is filled with the Angchu and Sensali Tengu along with Naga and Yeti.

·        Kaineng City: A gigantic and sprawling Metropolitan area-sized city with an overcrowded population density that covers nearly a third of the continent's land mass, it is the political capital of Cantha.

·        Echovald Forest: A petrified forest in the center of the mainland; this is where the secluded Kurzicks live and practice conservative politics as dictated by a culture of house ancestry, isolated from the Empire of the Dragon.

·        The Jade Sea: A large solidified sea in the center of the mainland, this is the home of the nomadic Luxons who enjoy liberal politics that favors a culture of tribal allegiance, independent of the Empire of the Dragon.

The Empire of the Dragon[edit]

The Empire of the Dragon is the sole human nation on the southern continent and it shares its second name with the continent it was founded on. Despite the Kurzicks and Luxons being vassals of the empire, the two factions are hardly bothered by the empire and its demands. The Empire of the Dragon is currently the oldest known human nation. 

The empire was formed by the warlord Kaineng Tah when he united the coastal tribes on the continent. Records claim that he was given a message by the Gods of Tyria. When he was killed, his son, Yian Zho took the throne and waged war on the Luxons and later Kurzicks, subjugating them to mass executions until they surrendered into becoming vassals.

*The defeat of Shiro Tagachi ended the plague that had afflicted Cantha. However, it took adventurers and members of the imperial guard a few grueling years to track down all of the Afflicted and the remnants of the Shiro'ken army that the Betrayer had unleashed in his final attempt to destroy the empire.* 

*Over the past few years, life has begun to spring up in Echovald Forest as many areas have seen new growth take hold. Some even claim to have seen a change in the Jade Sea—small pools of water forming or even waves moving beneath the frozen surface—but these reports are unsubstantiated rumors at best.* 

*Life has returned to normal for most Canthan residents. Kaineng still struggles under the burdens of bureaucracy, overpopulation, and crime, while the Kurzicks and Luxons remain locked in a never-ending battle over scant resources. Shing Jea Island remains an oasis of pristine valleys and beautiful vistas. Monks come to the island regularly for scholarly pursuits, while the general populace descends in droves for every festival held within the safe confines of Shing Jea Monastery.* 

*Commerce returned to a brisk pace once the Affliction ended, and since then, many Canthans have sought to re-establish old trade routes to Elona and Kryta as well as locate new opportunities farther north. However, recent reports of earthquakes and giant cracks opening in the middle of urban Cantha have some believing this time of relative peace and prosperity has now come to an end.* 

Five years after Shiro's return, the Ministry of Purity was formed in order to combat the continued threat of the Afflicted. In 1079 AE, the Afflicted were finally destroyed, though Cantha's citizens remained threatened by the relentless "turf wars" between the Am Fah and the Jade Brotherhood, inadvertently inflicting collateral damage and terror among the innocent. The continued focus on paperwork over actions by the Celestial Ministry held no benefit to the people either, creating a disdain for the government. Though previously able to help the people without being restricted by laws as they worked directly under Emperor Kisu, the Imperial Guards have now become hindered by the regulations and paperwork over the past seven years. Along with this, they are threatened by lingering Shiro'ken, who only assault the royal palace after Shiro's defeat. 

# Echovald Forest

The Echovald Forest is the ancestral home of the Kurzick people. Originally teeming with life, the Jade Wind has since petrified all natural life within the forest. Silence pervades the air that the music of life once filled. Despite the calamity that has befallen their home, the Kurzicks stayed, as only they were able to adapt to their new environment and carve dwellings amongst the petrified trees. Through the generations, life has found a way back into the forest, with unique species of flora and fauna thriving within the petrified forest.

## Amatz Basin

*Long before the Great Houses formed the Council of Nobles and the Kurzick nation, Amatz Basin was the site of a fierce battle between the zu Heltzers and the Vasburgs. What they fought over, none can remember, but the fighting took a terrible toll. Even worse (from the Kurzick perspective), thousands of the dead were left to rot where they fell. In recent years, the bones of those fallen warriors have begun to resurface, and the Kurzicks blame Urgoz, a corrupted forest spirit, for their ghastly exhumations.*

## Arborstone

The Arborstone area is wherein lies Cathedral zu Heltzer, the place where the sacred Kurzick relic, the Urn of Saint Viktor, is stored. After the Arborstone mission, the cathedral is now overrun by Wardens. In the watery lowlands surrounding the cathedral itself are groups of Dredge, Kirins, and hostile Plants.

For centuries the zu Heltzers have expanded and remodeled their House cathedral, adding new wings and levels on a yearly basis. Recently, the Council of Nobles determined the cathedral and the area around it should have an official name, since it had grown to the size of a large town. Count zu Heltzer predictably suggested the area be called Cathedral zu Heltzer, but the other House Nobles wouldn't hear of it, and Arborstone won the final vote.

### Altrumm Ruins

*The vast ruins of Altrumm are thought by most historians to be all that remains of the first great Kurzick city, destroyed by some ancient and mysterious catastrophe. The Kurzicks themselves claim their ancestors did not build the structures found here. If this is true, then Altrumm certainly influenced Kurzick architectural sensibilities.*

### Cathedral zu Heltzer

Cathedral zu Heltzer is the name given to the House zu Heltzer's cathedral designed by Count zu Heltzer. However, the Council of Nobles officially calls it Arborstone and some refer to it as Zu Heltzer Cathedral. 

At one time, the structure was warded to keep out Wardens and other creatures of the Echovald Forest, but these protective magics have decayed over time; the forest denizens now occupy the building and have forced the Kurzicks to leave. The Urn of Saint Viktor used to be displayed in the northwestern section of the cathedral proper; it was recently retrieved by Mhenlo and other adventurers to help defeat Shiro Tagachi.

### Tanglewood Copse

*A safe haven for travelers, Tanglewood Copse lies nestled between the outer edges of the southern Kaineng City and the harsh, towering Qinkaishi Mountains. According to legend, the first emperor stopped to camp here for the night during his inaugural tour of the Echovald Forest. It is now a site of pilgrimage for devotees of traditional Canthan ancestor worship.*

Tanglewood Copse lies on the northern edge of the Echovald Forest, and is the outpost one must pass to get there.

## Drazach Thicket

The part of the Echovald Forest known as the Drazach Thicket is different from most of the forest. There's little tree canopy overhead as this area consists of smaller trees and much shrubbery.

### Saint Anjeka’s Shrine

*Considered sacred ground to the Kurzicks, this shrine marks the spot where Saint Anjeka was struck down by raiding Luxons. Witnesses to the event that day claimed that Anjeka tried to dissuade the invaders from bloodshed by speaking the glory of the gods, but when a Luxon spear pierced her heart in the middle of her sermon, all hope of peace was shattered.*

## Ferndale

Ferndale lies southeast of the most prominent of the Great Kurzick Houses, House zu Heltzer. It features a central space that is relatively flat and open compared to the rest of the Echovald Forest. It is currently heavily populated by the Dredge, with Wardens mostly confined to the southern areas. The northwestern slopes are populated by Mantids due to the streams in that area.

### Aspenwood Gate (Kurzick)

*This fortress was designed by the famed Kurzick architect Lord Stein zu Heltzer more than five hundred years ago. One of the few remaining structures of true stone (which therefore dates from the time before the Jade Wind), Fort Aspenwood has long stood at a key strategic location along the Kurzick/Luxon border. The Kurzicks have managed to hold the fort against Luxon encroachment for centuries...but this arrangement may not last forever.*

### House zu Heltzer

*One of the oldest and largest of the Kurzick Houses, the zu Heltzers can trace their lineage to Saint Viktor and well beyond, a fact that they waste no opportunity to mention to newcomers. As masters of thought, magic, and architecture, their buildings are nothing short of exquisite, and getting past their magical wards and protections is nothing short of miraculous.*

### Lutgardis Conservatory

 

### Temple of the Dredge

The Temple of the Dredge is a decrepit temple located in Ferndale, part of the Echovald Forest. Despite its name, it was not constructed by the Dredge, who are a subterannean race. Before the Dredge arrived, the temple was inhabited by the Wardens; the temple itself has an unknown history.

### Saint Anjeka’s Shrine

 

## Fort Aspenwood (Kurzick)

*This fortress was designed by the famed Kurzick architect Lord Stein zu Heltzer more than five hundred years ago. One of the few remaining structures of true stone (which therefore dates from the time before the Jade Wind), Fort Aspenwood has long stood at a key strategic location along the Kurzick/Luxon border. The Kurzicks have managed to hold the fort against Luxon encroachment for centuries...but this arrangement may not last forever.*

### Gods’ Vengeance

Gods' Vengeance is a great weapon under the construction of the Kurzick Master Architect Gunther. The Luxons aim to destroy it before it is finished and it is the main objective of the Fort Aspenwood competitive mission. Little is known about it other than it is designed to "combine the elements of all five Kurzick Houses to protect the amber deposits nearby".

## Melandru’s Hope

Melandru's Hope is the part of Echovald Forest that has the largest amount of flourishing fauna, thus the name, giving hope that the effects of the Jade Wind are finally being overcome. Unfortunately, this area has large populations of Mantids, Dredge, and Wardens.

### Brauer Academy

*Members of House Brauer meet here to gossip, debate, and host celebrations. This Kurzick House is known for its exceptionally gifted sculptors and painters, whose artwork is coveted throughout the world. A favorite Brauer pastime: meeting in the courtyard after evening prayers to display their newest pieces de'arte.*

### Jade Flats (Kurzick)

*Although the Jade Sea more than lives up to its name, the jade that makes up its petrified waves is not necessarily of the best quality. The Jade Quarry has been literally carved from the stretch of seabed that contains the finest and most valuable jade derived from the mineralized bodies of countless sea creatures. Mining in the Jade Quarry is extremely dangerous, as the Kurzicks and Luxons are almost constantly fighting over this valuable resource.*

The Jade Flats is the outpost that separates the Jade Quarry from the Echovald Forest.

### Jade Quarry

*Although the Jade Sea more than lives up to its name, the jade that makes up its petrified waves is not necessarily of the best quality. The Jade Quarry has been literally carved from the stretch of seabed that contains the finest and most valuable jade derived from the mineralized bodies of countless sea creatures. Mining in the Jade Quarry is extremely dangerous, as the Kurzicks and Luxons are almost constantly fighting over this valuable resource.*

### Lutgardis Conservatory

*Previously known as Cypress Hollow, the Lutgardis House decided to build its cathedral and homes here after the House founder, Lord Rolf Lutgardis, came to this spot seeking guidance from the gods. According to legend, Lord Lutgardis was deep in prayer when a tree, weighed down by its heavy petrified limbs, finally gave way and crashed to the forest floor. It missed Lord Lutgardis by mere inches and was immediately declared a sign from the gods that this was a blessed place to all members of House Lutgardis.*

## Morostav Trail

Morostav Trail is a section of the Echovald Forest that borders the Jade Sea, close to the spot where the Jade Wind originated. As with other parts of the petrified forest, it is populated primarily by the Wardens, although there's a smattering of the Dredge as well as other wildlife.

### Durheim Archives

*The home of the scholarly House Durheim is not far from the border with the Jade Sea, but is well-protected by the dense petrified growth of the Echovald Forest and the waters of the Rijeka River. It is said that Durheim poetry owes its beauty not just to the innate talent of its authors, but to the natural splendor of nearby Mourning Veil Falls.*

Durheim Archives resides in the southeastern portion of the Echovald Forest, and is the closest outpost to the Jade Sea outside Unwaking Waters.

### Unwaking Waters (Kurzick)

*Previously the site of a floating temple known as Kuan Jun, the Harvest Temple, the Unwaking Waters is an immense, frozen whirlpool. When the Jade Winds passed over Cantha and Kuan Jun sunk beneath the ocean's surface, the whirlpool was formed, and like everything else in the path of the winds, became solid jade. Legends say a powerful dragon was trapped within the temple and lives there still.*

### Vasburg Armory

*The Vasburgs are brilliant military strategists and fighters. Their armory, which is the largest of its kind in Echovald, is filled with powerful weapons, murals of famous battles, and the spoils of years of warring against the Luxons.*

Vasburg Armory is the home of House Vasburg and resides nearby the Eternal Grove and its Forever Trees.

## Mourning Veil Falls

The Mourning Veil Falls area is named after a low waterfall bearing the same name, on the Rijeka River which is said to be flowing with the essence of the Echovald Forest. The Rijeka River cascades along in a series of waterfall across the southern end of the forest, heading out to the ocean.

The Mourning Veil Falls is a point on the Rijeka River near Durheim Archives and is called a "natural splendor." The water of the falls are said to have "special properties" and is even able to petrify objects.

### Rijeka River

The Rijeka River resides in the southern Echovald Forest and runs past Durheim Archives. The Mourning Veil Falls is a part of this river.

## The Eternal Grove

The Eternal Grove is a sacred location for the Kurzicks. This deep part of the Echovald Forest is where the Forever Trees grow -- the trees that contain the magic to transform Kurzick volunteers into Kurzick Juggernauts. The actual explorable area is much larger than the area accessible during the mission, minus the mission starting location (the gates to which are locked). The primary inhabitants in this area are hostile Plants and the Wardens, with a small group of Mantids around a small stream and lake near the center.

*For centuries the Kurzicks have gathered in the Eternal Grove to perform the ritual known as the Awakening. Outsiders are seldom allowed to witness this ceremony, so very little is known about it, except that this is how Kurzicks create the Forest Defenders who defend their lands from their enemies, the Luxons.*

The Eternal Grove is the home of the sacred Forever Trees and neighbors Vasburg Armory. As such, it is highly defended and prized by the Kurzicks.

### Forever Tree

The Forever Trees are special trees found in the Eternal Grove that can transform Kurzicks into juggernauts in a ceremony known as the Awakening. Each juggernaut is tied to one tree and is granted immortality so long as that tree lives. Even when destroyed in battle, the juggernauts will resurrect at their tree. 

If the Tree Singers stop singing the Songs of Arboreum during the Awakening ceremony, the Forever Trees will become dormant for a full year; however, if they are killed, the Forever Trees will die and be unable to create more juggernauts. 

Due to the juggernauts, the Forever Trees are the Kurzick's most prized area for their war against the Luxons.

## Urgoz’s Warren

This outpost is the staging-area for the elite mission of the same name. The party can have up to 12 characters and heroes.

# Kaineng City

## Bejunkan Pier

Bejunkan Pier is a dock area to the northwest of Kaineng Center. Most visitors or travelers from other continents set foot on Cantha here.

### Dragon Lighthouse

Multiple dragon lighthouses were constructed by the Empire of the Dragon. One can be found in the fog a distance away from Bejunkan Pier in Kaineng City, and a second lighthouse can be viewed on the southwest side of Shing Jea Island, off of Panjiang Peninsula, not far from Port Kaimu.

## Bukdek Byway

Bukdek Byway is a densely populated area of Kaineng City, with several levels of housing and confusing passages to navigate. The southeastern corner is controlled by the Am Fah of the Undercity while the Jade Brotherhood holds sway towards the northeast. The Afflicted have some presence in the center of the area.

## Dragon’s Throat

*The rumble of falling water does little to mask the unsavory business that thrives deep beneath Dragon's Throat. A massive sewer pipe at the far end of a subterranean hollow funnels sewage away from the prim and proper, adding insult to an already injured populace underground.*

This location draws its name from the opening of a massive sewer pipe.

## Divine Path

In the Divine Path, you can craft end-game armor (Canthan, Imperial, and Exotic) and if it is your first time through, you can get an Amulet of the Mists to exchange for a Unique item.

## Kaineng Center

*This area of Cantha's sprawling northern metropolis is also sometimes called "Old Kaineng" and is usually among the first stops of visitors to the Empire of the Dragon. Before the Jade Wind, the place now called Kaineng Center actually comprised most of Kaineng City, but the ensuing population explosion as citizens fled the affected regions led to an equal expansion of metropolitan boundaries. The central district's new, official moniker was approved by imperial decree in 1408 CC.*

Kaineng Center is the port town, economic hub and administrative center of the sprawling city of Kaineng on the northwestern coast of Cantha. The local architecture indicates what Kaineng City might have appeared before the advent of unchecked urban sprawl.

### Xunlai Headquarters

The Xunlai headquarters is the base of operation for the Xunlai Guild is located in the southern-most corridor of Kaineng Center. There is a large sealed off room containing countless Xunlai Chests, including the one magical chest that contains all of the items stored by the Xunlai.[1] That chest can be identified by the golden glow that surrounds it.

## Kaineng Docks

Kaineng Docks is the primary dock area where people travel to and from Seitung Harbor on Shing Jea Island.

## Nahpui Quarter

Nahpui Quarter is a slum area of Kaineng City, bordering the bustling Wajjun Bazaar and the quaint peacefulness around Senji's Corner. The Am Fah and the Jade Brotherhood make regular incursions into this area in an attempt to wrest control of this area.

*Though it appears to be just another of Kaineng City's numerous slum districts, the Nahpui Quarter is actually home to the Adepts who serve Suun, the mysterious Oracle of the Mists. Within these "slums" they study the words and teachings of the Oracle while protecting the downtrodden in secret. If you wish to become Closer to the Stars, this is the place to begin.*

Nahpui Quarter is one of the many slum districts that make up the majority of Kaineng City, housing its share of Kaineng's poor and underprivileged citizens.

### Royen’s Tree

Royen's tree is found a short distance outside of Senji's Corner in the center of Nahpui Quarter (explorable area). It is home to Royen Beastkeeper.

### Senji’s Corner

*Locals have dubbed this corner of town "Senji's Corner", for the eccentric old man who lives there. Most think his odd riddles nothing but the ramblings of an insane man, but those who take the time to listen can learn new paths...*

Senji's Corner is basically just a small section of a slums district that's named after Senji, a profession changer.

## Pongmei Valley

Pongmei Valley, a small hilly area adjacent to the Echovald Forest and the Jade Sea, is the only part of Kaineng City which hasn't been covered by urban sprawl.

### Maatu Keep

*One of the oldest sections of Kaineng City, Maatu Keep sits at the base of the Qinkaishi Mountains and serves as the city's entry point for both Luxons and Kurzicks. The keep, once a beautiful example of ancient Canthan architecture, has since fallen into neglect and disrepair*.

Maatu Keep sits at the edge of Kaineng City and now serves as the main passage to and from Kaineng for Kurzicks and Luxons.

## Qinkaishi Mountains

The Qinkaishi Mountains are the small but tall and harsh mountain range within central Cantha, lying on the borders of The Jade Sea, Echovald Forest, and Kaineng City. Mount Qinkai is the most prominent of these mountains. The mountains are known to be the home of many Yeti.

### Minister Wona’s Estate

Minister Wona's estate is a large complex owned by Wona, the Minister of War for the Empire of the Dragon. It is located high up in the mountains to the far south of Kaineng City and west of the southern Echovald Forest. Within the estate grounds is Master Riyo's dojo.

## Raisu Palace

Raisu Palace of the Emperor of Cantha is an explorable area east of the Kaineng Center. Construction on the palace began in 510 BE, commissioned by Kaineng Tah. It was burned down in 694 AE with Emperor Singtah inside. The palace began to be rebuilt in the same year, being finished over eighty years later and is considered the one great achievement of Emperor Senvho's reign. 

The palace features towering walls, elaborately-carved jade pathways, and intricately-decorated pagodas, and splendor that sets it worlds apart from the squalor of the Kaineng City poor. It even has an extensive private dock area on the northern side.

### Raisu Palace

*Emperor Senvho commissioned the rebuilding of Raisu Palace after it mysteriously burned to the ground in the year 1204, killing his father, Emperor Singtah. It took over 80 years to finish the construction on the elaborate palace, but once completed, it was considered the one great achievement of Emperor Senvho's reign.*

### Raisu Pavilion

Raisu Pavilion is the entrance to the grand Raisu Palace. Despite the palace being blocked off to players early on, this area is available immediately. This explorable area is very small and, unlike all the other areas you can visit early in the game, Raisu Pavilion is themed to Raisu Palace rather than the actual city.

### Imperial Sanctum

*Only the emperor, his family, and his most trusted guards can access the inner chamber of the palace. To date, no one has ever managed to breach the walls to the sanctuary, or at least lived to tell about it.*

The Imperial Sanctum is the innermost chambers of the palace of the Canthan Empire.

## Shadow’s Passage

Shadow's Passage is a narrow passage below the palace. It only functions as the route between Bukdek Byway and Dragon's Throat.

## Shenzun Tunnels

The Shenzun Tunnels is a part of Kaineng City that lies close to ground-level, close to the dirty sewage that drains from other parts of the city. It is likely that the extremely poor would reside here, concentrated mostly in the northern areas and in the center. The Am Fah have a presence here, concentrated mostly on the southwestern and northeastern corners - a result of the Afflicted having taken over the other parts.

## Sunjiang District

Sunjiang District is a densely-populated suburban area of Kaineng City that has its southern and western areas infested with the Afflicted. Where the Afflicted do not wander, the Am Fah still hold sway.

*Once a business district, this area was converted into living quarters after the Jade Wind obliterated much of the countryside. As flocks of refugees made there way into Kaineng City, the Celestial Ministry sent them to Sunjiang District, where they were assigned to a street block and allowed to build a 10-foot-by-10-foot living space.*

### Zin Ku Corridor

*This dark, humid, and smelly corridor may not look like much, but it leads followers deep into the sewers to Tahnnakai Temple. Some of the city's most unsavory guilds have been known to assign thugs to this corridor, who lie in wait to ambush unsuspecting passersby on their way to the temple.*

## Tahnnakai Temple

The great Tahnnakai Temple is where the ancient Souls of Cantha's greatest heroes are housed and are serviced by Sai Ling Order. This area is filled with non-hostile Temple Guardians and the spirits of ancient heroes but the northern section is filled with dangerous Temple Guardians and large numbers of Jade Brotherhood.

*For centuries, Tahnnakai Temple has housed the souls of Cantha's most revered heroes. The bravest and most accomplished member of each profession rests here, tended by priests of the Sai Ling Order. Ornate statues line the great hall, each a stunning likeness of the hero it represents. These magnificent effigies, sculpted by Kurzick artisans, are enchanted with protective magic that guards the temple and its inhabitants from harm.*

Tahnnakai Temple is an ancient temple that houses the souls of revered heroes and heroines of Cantha.

## The Undercity

The Undercity is an effectively underground part of Kaineng City, so much has been built above it. It is dominated by the Am Fah, whose guild hall is located here.

### Am Fah’s Guild Hall

The Am Fah's guild hall is located deep within the Undercity and is the main base of operations for the Am Fah. The quests Chasing Zenmai and Capturing the Orrian Tome take place here. 

When there are no active quests that affect the mobs in the area, three female Canthan Peasants can be seen dancing for Mina Shatter Storm and other Am Fah.

## Vizunah Square

### Foreign Quarter

*Once home to the famous assassin Vizu, inhabitants of this neighborhood successfully petitioned the Celestial Ministry in the year 1396 to rename it in honor of the woman who had helped bring down Shiro the Betrayer.*

### Local Quarter

*Once home to the famous assassin Vizu, inhabitants of this neighborhood successfully petitioned the Celestial Ministry in the year 1396 to rename it in honor of the woman who had helped bring down Shiro the Betrayer*

## Wajjun Bazaar

Wajjun Bazaar is a busy and prosperous seafront in central Kaineng. A variety of goods and services are available here, since local imports make their way to the other parts of Kaineng from here. The Am Fah have made inroads from the Undercity into this area and control much of the southern roads and alleys, much to the annoyance of the Jade Brotherhood whose guild hall is on the island in the northwest.

### Jade Brotherhood’s Guild Hall

The Jade Brotherhood's guild hall is located on an island pier at the north of Wajjun Bazaar. Despite being assaulted multiple times over the past several years, the Jade Brotherhood maintain a stranglehold over the island.

### The Marketplace

*A favorite destination for locals and foreign visitors alike, this bustling marketplace is the place to find locally made trinkets, fresh products and fish, and traditional Canthan delicacies such as pickled vermin tongue.*

The Marketplace is a bustling and popular trading place for locals and foreigners alike. The location of being close to Kaineng City's center and being next to Kaineng Docks probably contributed much to its popularity.

## Xaquang Skyway

Xaquang Skyway is the result of vertical expansion of Kaineng City's populace. The people in this area constructed their living areas over older streets and districts, casting deep shadows and gloom over the ground-level areas, resulting in what is now referred to as the Undercity. While the shadowy streets and sewers below are controlled by the Am Fah, Xaquang Skyway is the domain of the Jade Brotherhood. Small groups of mantids, as well as Tengu of the Roost, are found in the northern parts of this area. The western streets are mostly abandoned, burned out ruins now swarming with large vermin.

### The Roost

The Roost is found a little ways outside of Senji's Corner in northern Xaquang Skyway. It is home to Angchu Tengu that have found life inside the city gates.

# Shing Jea Island

Shing Jea Island lies to the west of the Canthan mainland, southwest across the sea from Kaineng City. It is an idyllic place with farming and fishing settlements sparsely dotting the rural countryside. The primary population centers include Shing Jea Monastery and Seitung Harbor; the former being a center for profession training and latter the primary docks and center of trade for the island. 

New Factions characters begin the campaign on this island, at the Monastery Overlook next to Shing Jea Monastery itself. Characters from other campaigns will need to travel to Seitung Harbor by boat from Kaineng Docks on the mainland (outside the Marketplace). First Mate Xiang can be found in both those locations to offer passage to and from the island.

## Haiju Lagoon

Haiju Lagoon comprises most of the lowlands of northeastern Shing Jea Island, including a somewhat large lagoon in its center that gives this area its name. The locals settled on the slopes to form Jatin Village and Linkei Township. The Crimson Skull has taken over Hanzing Pier in the northeast while an abandoned Daochu Village is along the norther beach, well within Naga territory.

### Daochu Village

Daochu Village is a small settlement of a few rough wooden hutson and a cave at the northen tip of Haiju Lagoon. According to Miller Quang, it used to be a human settlement until the Naga took over.

### Haiju Lagoon (Landmark)

The Haiju Lagoon is the large lagoon that the Haiju Lagoon explorable area is named after. It covers a sizable portion of the northern region of the map, and is home to many Dragon Lillies and Grasping Roots. In the middle of the lagoon lays Teipao Island, home of the legendary Bog Beast of Bokku. 

The lagoon provides the Haiju Lagoon Water effect to anyone standing in its shallow, magic waters: every time you use a skill, you gain 25 health.

### Hanzing Pier

Hanzing Pier is a harbor on the north-eastern coast in Haiju Lagoon. The pier is under control of the Crimson Skull and is guarded by large numbers of their members.

### Jatin Village

Jatin Village is a small settlement located in the southwest of Haiju Lagoon, just by Wahju Falls.

### Linkei Township

Linkei Township is a small village a bit south from Haiju Lagoon. Some NPCs will offer services and quests here.

### Teipao Island

Teipao Island is the small island in the middle of the lagoon that gives the Haiju Lagoon explorable area its name. The island and the supposed caves below it are home to the legendary Bog Beast of Bokku.

### Wahju Falls

Wahju Falls is an impressive series of waterfall from the highest point of Haiju Lagoon and down into the lagoon that gives this area its name. Linkei Township, a human settlement, lies next to the falls and overlooks the lagoon below.

## Jaya Bluffs

Jaya Bluffs is the name given to the eastern half of Shing Jea Island's central mountain range. The bluffs are comprised of snow-covered mountains and inhabited by the warring Yeti and Sensali Tengu. Jaya Bluffs also overlooks the beaches on the northern side of the island, and settlements can be seen along the beach. A small encampment of Canthans are also found in the northwestern corner; what they are doing there is not known.

### Kaanai Caverns

The Kaanai Caverns is a large system of inter-connected caves in the mountains on the northeastern side of Jaya Bluffs. The shortest path to Haiju Lagoon is through these caverns. Unfortunately, it is used by the Yeti as their lair. 

A Statue of Lyssa can also be found in one of the side caves, serving as a Resurrection Shrine.

### Linnok Courtyard

Linnok Courtyard is a small plateau on the eastern side of Shing Jea Monastery, atop a relatively long flight of stairs. This courtyard also connects to Saoshang Trail, the only route from the western half of Shing Jea Island to Seitung Harbor and the eastern half.

### Monastery Overlook

Overlooking Shing Jea Monastery, this is the location of the Shing Jea Boardwalk and the training site for the monastery's newest students. 

For newly-created Factions characters, the objective at this point is to gain entrance into Shing Jea Monastery. If this is the first time you are playing Guild Wars, or would like to do the tutorial, speak to Instructor Ng and follow the instructions. To skip the tutorial, follow Master Togo up the slope and talk to Ludo.

#### Shing Jea Boardwalk

The Shing Jea Boardwalk is a venue for activities and games of chance during certain special events. It is located in the Monastery Overlook of Shing Jea Monastery.

#### Shing Jea Dojo

The Shing Jea Dojo is a small training area in the Monastery Overlook used by the monastery instructors to give students some practical advanced training.

### Miki Lake

Miki Lake is a small, frozen lake located in the highland center of Jaya Bluffs. Groups of hostile Tengu and Yeti roam its surface and surrounding areas. 

While walking over the lake you will be under the effect of Icy Ground.

### Saoshang Trail

The narrow Saoshang Trail curves with the southern edge of the central mountain range as it connects Shing Jea Monastery to Seitung Harbor. It is the only available pass that lies south of the mountains. The trail itself is not without dangers, as mantids are known to wander the trail and hide in trees to ambush travelers.

### Seitung Harbor

*The largest and arguably most important port in Cantha, Seitung Harbor is the point of entry for most outsiders. Ships traveling to distant Tyria or the far-flung Battle Isles depart from Seitung Harbor with dizzying regularity, while the traffic from those distant lands arrives with equal frequency. Canthans with little spare time often say they are "busy as a Seitung Harbormaster". At least, in polite company.*

### Minister Cho’s Estate

The sprawling compound of Minister Cho's Estate encompasses a large part of central Shing Jea Island, taking up most of the land to the north of the central mountain range. The estate grounds have mostly been turned into a zoo of sorts, home to a myriad variety of exotic animals from all over the world of Tyria.

*The Minister's Estate is the second-oldest example of classical Canthan architecture still standing on Shing Jea Island. An ever-more-extravagant series of occupants has led to steady expansion; the current estate is three times the size of the original. It still serves the purpose for which it was constructed: it is the traditional residence for the Canthan Minister of Cultural Affairs assigned to the Shing Jea Monastery and surrounding area, a position currently held by Minister Cho. His menagerie of exotic animals from across the globe is considered to be one of the finest collections in the world.*

The relatively more inland areas have wandering groups of Kappa.

### Dragon Lighthouse

Multiple dragon lighthouses were constructed by the Empire of the Dragon. One can be found in the fog a distance away from Bejunkan Pier in Kaineng City, and a second lighthouse can be viewed on the southwest side of Shing Jea Island, off of Panjiang Peninsula, not far from Port Kaimu.

Thanks to the preservation efforts of Master Togo, wealthy tourists from Kaineng City have so far been prevented from spoiling Tsumei Village's idyllic splendor and historic buildings.*

Tsumei Village is a small village located to the west of Shing Jea Monastery. It is situated at the pass that provides the shortest route to the southwestern portion of Shing Jea Island from Shing Jea Monastery.

## Shing Jea Arena

*By longstanding tradition, full-scale arena combat is prohibited on the rural island of Shing Jea, out of reverence for the monastery of the same name. Yet those who study at the monastery require a place to train in such arts. The solution? Shing Jea Arena, located on the tiny island of Tinnairukan south of the larger landmass... close enough to train, but separated from Shing Jea Island itself.*

The Shing Jea Arena is one of the maps in rotation in Random and Codex Arena, and the map is also accessible through Shing Jea Monastery as an arena for characters between levels 1 to 10 and during the quest The Final Confrontation. 

The arena has a couple of distinct features. Upon entering the battle, you will see two Miasma fields to both your left and right, regardless of what side you started on. The arena is divided by a shallow river in the middle which players can easily cross over with no effects to them. There is also a bridge that spans the river.

## Sunqua Vale

Sunqua Vale is an idyllic location nestled between the mountains and the southwestern cliffs of Shing Jea Island. It includes portions of the short east-west mountain range of which Tomaat Pass leads from the Shrine of Maat towards the western coast of the island. The lowland areas of this area are sparsely populated by simple Mantids and wandering Kappa. Towards the western end, near Lake Puang, some Naga can be encountered. The snowy mountain range is slightly more dangerous, with bands of Sensali Tengu and the Crimson Skull patrolling about. 

This is the first explorable area where new players will encounter hostile enemies. The Mantids (excluding a few in Zhengjo Temple), Kappa, and Naga in the area are passive until attacked first, but the Sensali, the Yetis, and the Crimson skull band encountered in the northern mountainous paths do attack on aggro.

### Kaabo Cemetery

The Kaabo Cemetery is a small shrine located in the south of Sunqua Vale, to the east of Tsumei Village. It serves as a burial vault for the ashes of the deceased.

### Lake Puang

Lake Puang is a large pond in a cave-like gorge in Sunqua Vale, north-west of Tsumei Village. The impressive Zen Nai Falls feed it with fresh waters from the surrounding mountains, and it is an important source of drinking water for the humans of the area. 

The gorge is populated by a large band of naga.

### Shrine of Maat

The Shrine of Maat is a small temple that is located in the north-western part of the mountain ranges in Sunqua Vale. It can only be accessed by crossing the bridge from the south.

### Temku Caverns

The Temku Caverns is a small cave system that almost connects to Zhengjo Temple in Sunqua Vale. It is located on the eastern end of Minister Cho's Estate and its entrance is a short climb up a narrow path. The caverns appear to be used as a storage area.

### Tomaat Pass

Tomaat Pass is a north-south path through the western end of the snowy mountain range that stretches from Sunqua Vale to the western coast of Shing Jea Island. It connects the northern and southern areas of Kinya Province and provides access to the trail through the mountain range and into Sunqua Vale. Yeti are known to lair in caves along the pass.

*The valley of Zen Daijun has long been a holy place to the people of Cantha and a destination for pilgrims seeking enlightenment on Shing Jea Island. It is the home of Zunraa, an ancient protector that takes the form of a Kirin. Many weary travelers have been buoyed by the restorative properties of Zunraa's ancient shrines, which still stand to this day.*

The unpopulated eastern end of Shing Jea Island has long been considered a sacred place by the people of the Cantha.

### Daijun Library

Daijun Library is an old library found in the Zen Daijun valley. During the Zen Daijun mission, it is where the party and Togo discovers the guild mark of Shiro Tagachi's guild, and realizes Shiro might be the source of the plague and the afflicted.

The island is guarded by Naga in large numbers, lead by their boss Tin Dao Kaineng. Furthermore some Kappa and Bonesnap Turtles can be found on the nearby beaches. 

Hidden on the island is the Old Chest with Miller Quang's Sentimental Treasures.

# The Jade Sea

The Jade Sea is located on the southeastern side of the Canthan continent. It is the home of the Luxons, whose entire watery realm was frozen into solid jade when the Jade Wind swept across the region.

## Archipelagos

The Archipelagos is an area of the Jade Sea that lies south of Cavalon. Due to its proximity to the mainland, this area is riddled with small islands that jut out of the frozen sea. A large settlement of Naga can be found in the south.

### Breaker Hollow

Formed out of the hull of a ship that was grounded during the Jade Winds, this small outpost serves as a place for Luxons to convene and trade goods.

### Jade Arena

The Jade Arena is an arena in the Archipelagos to the west of Cavalon, north-west of the Jade Flats, where Convicted Criminals and wild animals compete in gladiatorial matches organised by Arena Master Portus. The quest here allows you to take part in this competition; it is a repeatable event and gives you Luxon faction.

## Boreas Seabed

The Boreas Seabed refers to the northernmost shores of the Jade Sea and its surrounding areas. There are plenty of Naga and Outcasts found on the frozen waves. The eastern end of this area is the location of the Luxons' Convocation.

### 1,000 Daggers Guild Hall

The guild hall of the 1,000 Daggers Canthan NPC guild, found on the edge of the Jade Sea, in the north-eastern corner of the Boreas Seabed. The path leading to the guild hall is populated by enemy Luxon monks, assassins, necromancers and elementalists, all presumably of the 1,000 Daggers guild.

### Boreas Seabed (OUtpost)

*The site of many of the greatest battles in Luxon history, the Boreas Seabed is also the home range of Zhu Hanuku, or "Old Long-arms" in the ancient tongue. Every year, this mammoth kraken arises from the petrified seas to lash out at the Luxon capital of Cavalon. The souls of the great Luxon champions are also said to remain here, watching over their descendants.*

### Cavalon

*Although Cavalon is the Luxon's home settlement, most prefer to stay on the move, returning only once every decade, when the Convocation brings together all of the three armadas. Traders from around the world come to buy the precious jade and rare seashells that the Luxon merchants sell here.*

Cavalon is the town of the Jade Sea. It is also one of the few places that allows access to the Deep.

### The Deep

This outpost is the staging-area for the elite mission of the same name. The party can have up to 12 characters and heroes.

### Halcyon

Halcyon is a Leviathan, a giant fish-shaped vessel used by the Luxon Serpent Clans. It is located a short distance north of Zos Shivros Channel in the Boreas Seabed.

### Zos Shivros Channel

*Infamous for sending many sailors to their watery deaths back when ships still sailed the Jade Sea, this once-treacherous channel is now traversed mostly by Luxons as they make their way to their home settlement, Cavalon.*

## Gyala hatchery

The Gyala Hatchery explorable area is the stretch of Jade Sea that lies between the capital, Cavalon, and the Luxons' turtle hatchery. It is a somewhat dangerous stretch of land that is littered with Naga and Yeti to the north, while the south is dominated by Fishes, Leviathans, and Luxon Outcasts.

### Flooded Jade Mine

The Flooded Jade Mine is a mine in the Gyala Hatchery that seems to be flooded with water.

The Eye of the North manual says that there are rumors of pools of water being found. This line may be in reference to this location.

### Gyala Hatcher (Outpost)

*The largest hatchery of its kind, Gyala Hatchery supplies a wide variety of eggs and hatchlings, including many species of fish and other aquatic life unavailable since the Jade Winds passed over the oceans. The hatchery is also the world's primary provider of giant turtle hatchlings, primarily for purchase by the Luxon Turtle Clan.*

Gyala Hatchery is a place protected by the Turtle Clan and is where the Luxons' massive beasts are raised.

### Petrified Leviathan

Petrified leviathans are a few of many creatures petrified by the Jade Wind. There are several of these leviathans throughout the Jade Sea. A few of them can be seen in Gyala Hatchery and Rhea's Crater, such as the two behind Incetol, Devout of Depths or the larger leviathan in the center of Rhea's Crater. 

One leviathan in the Deep breaks free from its imprisonment, suggesting that some of the other leviathans are still living trapped in the solid sea.

## Jade Flats

Although the Jade Sea more than lives up to its name, the jade that makes up its petrified waves is not necessarily of the best quality. The Jade Quarry has been literally carved from the stretch of seabed that contains the finest and most valuable jade derived from the mineralized bodies of countless sea creatures. Mining in the Jade Quarry is extremely dangerous, as the Kurzicks and Luxons are almost constantly fighting over this valuable resource.

### The Jade Quarry

*Although the Jade Sea more than lives up to its name, the jade that makes up its petrified waves is not necessarily of the best quality. The Jade Quarry has been literally carved from the stretch of seabed that contains the finest and most valuable jade derived from the mineralized bodies of countless sea creatures. Mining in the Jade Quarry is extremely dangerous, as the Kurzicks and Luxons are almost constantly fighting over this valuable resource.*

## Maishang Hills

The Maishang Hills is the hilly area that lies to the northeast of the Jade Sea. The hills are populated by Naga and Rot Wallows, while the shores see many Kappa groups.

### Bai Passu Reach

*This small mountain town has stood in one form or another for almost eight hundred years, as can be seen by the traditional stone architecture of indisputably Canthan origin. Once a way station for weary travelers and swift-footed messengers, it has of late become a popular vacation spot for wealthy Canthan tourists who value its remote location.*

### Eredon Terrace

*This remote Luxon outpost is the site of the Eredon jade-smasher apparatus, an experimental device of Canthan design that allows huge chunks of jade to be reduced to smaller size for ease of transport. A small village has sprung up around this structure.*

## Mount Qinkai

Mount Qinkai is a foothill of the Qinkaishi Mountains that form a natural barrier between the northern areas of the Jade Sea and the Echovald Forest. The actual accessible area is in fact just the eastern slope that lies in the northwestern-most section of Luxon ancestral territories. In the middle of this area is a long scenic lake that is fed by a tall waterfall cascading down off a cliff.

## Rhea’s Crater

Rhea's Crater lies on the eastern end of the Jade Sea. The whole of the area appears to be a large Luxon quarry with deep excavation works being carried out in multiple places. The unearthed jade stands as a grim reminder of the day the Jade Sea became frozen, as the preserved remains of fish, serpents, and other aquatic life forms can be seen within the jade blocks. The southern part of this area are narrow and deep pathways riddling through blocks of jade. The northern and middle portions are on higher ground with ledges where mining works are being carried out. The middle area also contains a small flooded section in the east. This area is crawling with Jade Sea wildlife and the Outcasts maintain long and fast patrols throughout this area.

### Aurios Mines

*Relics of a mysterious race, possibly an offshoot of the Deldrimor dwarves, have been uncovered in this productive jade mine. Though not as large or strategically vital as the enormous Jade Quarry, the Aurios Mines are of great importance to historians and scholars.*

The Aurios Mines is a mine located deep within the Jade Sea. It is besieged by the Nightmare Horde, the minions of Kanaxai.

### Creon Jade Mine

The Creon Jade Mine is a small mine in the Jade Sea, south of Gyala Hatchery, that is connected to the Leviathan Pits. A crab-like leviathan ship resides here.

### Leviathan Pits

*This relatively small but well-protected jade mine is deep within Luxon territory and is dominated by a structure built from a mammoth tortoise shell. Some of the most valuable and exquisitely preserved examples of jade fossils have been discovered here, and many can be found within Master Togo's personal collection at the Shing Jea library.*

## Silent Surf

The Silent Surf stands as a prominent reminder of what once were the roiling waves of the Jade Sea, now frozen jade. This area probably had turbulent waves a long time ago, as evidenced by the large waves that were forever stopped in their travel to the shore. Three small islands stand amidst the jade waves, two of them connected by bridges to the mainland. Many forms of native wildlife roam the surface of the jade together with bands of Outcasts. The Afflicted have a presence here as well, and can be found near and on the two northern islands.

### Seafarer’s Rest

*Once a quiet destination for the Luxon elite, Seafarer's Rest now serves as a mere resting stop for weary travelers meandering across the Jade Sea. The wealthy sat perched atop towering rock structures, with every need attended to by a staff of attentive servants. Those who currently inhabit this outpost subsist on funds from odd jobs and mercenary work; though some say Seafarer's Rest will one day return to its former stature.*

## Unwaking Waters

### Harvest Temple

*The site of Cantha's most infamous murder, the Harvest Temple in which Emperor Angsiyan was struck down by the treacherous Shiro Tagachi still stands. It is the geographic epicenter of the Jade Wind; a place of fear, danger, and bitter memories. Here the mighty dragon Kuunavang still lurks in the caverns beneath the temple, utterly corrupted by the proximity of Shiro's death wail.*

The Harvest Temple, also known as Kuan Jun Temple, was the holy place where the annual Harvest Ceremony took place. Before the Jade Wind, the Harvest Temple was a floating temple. It began to sink at the beginning of the Jade Wind causing the waters around it to create a whirlpool which was quickly frozen by the wind's petrifying affect.

### Unwaking Waters (Outpost)

*Previously the site of a floating temple known as Kuan Jun, the Harvest Temple, the Unwaking Waters is an immense, frozen whirlpool. When the Jade Winds passed over Cantha and Kuan Jun sunk beneath the ocean's surface, the whirlpool was formed, and like everything else in the path of the winds, became solid jade. Legends say a powerful dragon was trapped within the temple and lives there still.*
