### Giganticus Lupicus

I am currently working on a world conversion of GW (currently starting on Prophecies) and came across a small detail I'm trying to figure out between GW1 and GW2.

- On the [GW1 Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Giganticus_Lupicus), Giganticus Lupicus went extinct very early on, but no one appears to know anything about the extinction.
- On the [GW2      Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Great_Giant), Giganticus Lupicus are believed to have gone extinct because of the elder dragons.

This leads me to a few small assumptions, as I've not seen otherwise in my searching:

1. In the setting of GW1, nothing is known yet about the Giganticus Lupicus.
2. The only historical information that holds possible information to the Giganticus Lupicus is in ancient historical texts from the old races, and is not currently in public or shared knowledge.
3. By the time period of GW2, the Durmand Priory gets a bit more information and believes the Elder Dragons are the cause of the Giganticus Lupicus' extinction.

So - in order to be as faithful as possible to the lore, are my assumptions correct, or is there something I'm missing? Any help is greatly appreciated!

**Answer**

In GW1, it's known that the Giganticus Lupicus died out ~10,000 BE. This comes from the timeline in the manuals and is more or less the sole GW1 lore on the Giganticus Lupicus.

In GW2, the Priory [believe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Stinn) (with some support [for](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Ruined_City_of_Arah_(explorable)#Jotun) [it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mursaat_Lore_Tablet) and [against](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bad_Blood#Dialogue) [it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Return_to_Camp_Resolve#Other_Dialogue)) that the Elder Dragons' last rising period was ~10,000 BE. There is also a risen Giganticus Lupicus from the previous dragonrise (fought in Arah explorable). So it's theorized in-universe that the Elder Dragons are what caused the Giganticus Lupicus' extinction (there are also [charr legends](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Myths_and_Legends_of_Ancient_Ascalon) that further this claim). It basically is a case of the Durmand Priory learning things (as in GW1, next to nothing was known about the Elder Dragons, especially to humans, but digging through forbidden dwarven texts, jotun stelae, charr legends, and Forgotten records - all of which unavailable to humans in GW1 - has led figuring these things out).

While generally what [u/sirjisu](https://www.reddit.com/u/sirjisu) said is true about GW1 and GW2 lore, but I wouldn't say "did the Elder Dragons kill the Giganticus Lupicus" is one of them. There are also quite a handful of cases where GW2 lore is a bit contradictory with itself, too. We know that the Elder Dragons were around while the GL were, but we don't know:

1. If that was the last awakening for sure (see contradictory lore in GW2; some sources, mainly around Glint and Forgotten, say 3,000 years while other sources, mainly from the Priory, says 10,000 years)
2. And if the Elder Dragons wiped them out, or if it's a case of correlation not causation with the timeframes.
