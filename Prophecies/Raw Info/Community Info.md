### Classes

#### In General

- **Possible Suggestions in alignment for current D&D5 classes - <u>*some of these are GW2 specific classes.*</u>** 

  | 5e Class  | GW Subclass    | Core Mechanic                                                |
  | --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Barbarian | Berserker      | Adrenaline as a resource to fuel "burst attacks" which as attacks with special effects. |
  | Bard      | Chronomancer   | Gish class with high defensive capabilities. Access to stronger versions of slow/haste. Continuum split at high levels |
  | Cleric    | Firebrand      | Spell scrolls. Books/fire/quickness                          |
  | Druid     | Druid          | Druid is already druid enough, so the subclass focuses on the pet mechanic |
  | Fighter   | Spellbreaker   | Anti-magic theme. Adrenaline for burst attacks (like Berserker) but with full counter |
  | Monk      | Daredevil?     | Focus on dodging, use of staff                               |
  | Paladin   | Dragonhunter   | Maybe a more "trap" focused paladin with symbols and longbow support |
  | Ranger    | Soulbeast      | Giving the player "beast attacks" and enhancing base ranger abilities |
  | Rogue     | Mirage?        | Magical rogue without spells                                 |
  | Sorcerer  | Weaver         | Attunement as a bonus action. Expanded spell list from attunement, as well as active and passive bonuses |
  | Warlock   | Herald/Ventari | Warlock focused on healing. Has ventari tablet and focuses on auras |
  | Wizard    | Scourge        | Necromancy spells and sand manipulation abilities. Focuses on area control and temp hp |

  **Elite specializations not accounted for:**

  Renegade/Mallyx (also warlock), Scrapper (artificer), Holosmith (maybe artificer or maybe some wacky barbarian), Deadeye (probably rogue), Tempest (Bard or Sorcerer). Reaper (anti-paladin?)

  **Also some side-note:**

  I came into several snags while trying to develop mechanical equivalents for the subclasses. Here's a list of them so far. I wanted to focus on making themes and mechanics feel very 5e, but just in a different universe.

  1. GW2's combat system is cooldown based, so figuring out how to translate this into power with spells and abilities is difficult. 5e relies heavily on once/time period mechanics, as giving every class spells doesn't make sense. Healing is also a really tough one, because GW2 healing tends to be more healing over time based, whereas 5e only has a concept of burst heal.
  2. Conditions are something difficult to translate over. I toyed with a simple condition system of injury/regeneration, (flat healing/damage per turn), protection/vulnerability (flat damage taken decrease/increase), might/weakness (flat outgoing damage increase/decrease). This would be an interesting way of buffing weapons with lower damage die by giving them conditions, to preserve that aspect of gameplay. However, I ultimately scrapped this as keeping track of these numbers was too complicated to feel 5e. I ended up with a system that avoids conditions and translate that into
  3. Guild wars elite specializations can fundamentally change a class. I originally toyed with the idea that an elite spec can be a choice that a class makes later on, but this turns out to be problematic because some skills that an elite specialization gives are super overpowered in a 5e setting (continuum split) and some would be incredibly underwhelming. I was also torn between making classes for each class, and then subclasses for each elite spec, but I felt that the more I toyed with this the further I deviated from 5e mechanically, and lost a lot of what makes 5e good.
  4. Engineer doesn't fit well into 5e, which is a class that is more steampunk/scifi than 5e's fantasy. You kinda need to use a new class to fit Engineer well. Luckily, we have Artificer
  5. Combos fields aren't a thing in 5e. A lot of things that normally relies on combo fields you have to get rid of.

  I settled on making subclasses: it was a perfect balance of maintaining 5. My short term goal is to make a Guild Wars 2 elite specialization for each main class in 5e, and also homebrew Races. Here's my plans thus far: some are far more fleshed out than others. Note for warlock, I combined mechanics of an elite spec with it's commonly used supporting invocation.

- Technically secondaries can work in the 5e system with an overhaul of multi-class rules. Example being removal of attribute restriction for lvl 1 to multi class, but higher levels might have requirements to emulate GW1 attribute system.

  Monk and Dervish would both be roughly analogous to the Cleric/Paladin classes, with devotion to a specific God as a requirement - not exactly the case for Monks in Guild Wars, but certainly for Dervishes.

  Ritualists are an interesting case in that there is very little in the existing 5e classes that could be adapted for them. The reliance on Souls rather than fleshy constructs is great material for a homebrew though, excited to see how this fleshes out.

  Bard would be a suitable mesmer class, or Bladesinger wizard might work too.  An enchantment and illusions based gish of sorts. *that playstyle only focuses on the illusion magic which gw2 did and it made the mesmer feels very one dimensional.*

  I agree about monks being clerics specifically healing/protection and war gods but the Dervish is a mixed bag in my opinion. If anything I think it'd require being a subclass that is more concentration spell focused (example being able to concentrate on more than 1 spell but much shorter duration  and the ability to purge them for extra effect, etcs)

  The only problem I have with a warlock/bard/tricky wizard for mesmers is that it only covers the illusion side of the meaner magic. It doesn't fit any flavour towards their use of signets, their multitude of stances, the ability to drain mana/spells or being a magic mimic.

  I think there is room to take them into a more interesting role than just "illusion mage" like gw2 made them.

- I think the subclass system in 5e would cover *most* of the dual class options as they are in GW1 (I loved that game), though some gaps might exist. Where I'd focus:

  Figuring out the Mesmer. It's probably a bard, but might need its own college.

  Tweaking the options for necromancers, including finding ways for minion masters to work.

  Cleric-monks. I'd probably start with cleric, and swap out heavy armor for martial arts, but that needs balancing.

#### In General: Necromancer

- I wanted to explain why gw1 necros need corpses to create minions, while gw2 just summon them. It's not just a gameplay mechanic, since we have seen NPCs (like Trahearn) summon minions. So I went like this:

  Necromancers still need a corpse to create a minion, though more experienced necromancers can unsummon a minion they have already created and summon it again later when they need it on the battle. So, necromancers can either use a corpse on a battle to summon a minion, or must have already made one and summon it. In this idea, necromancers of the gw1 age haven't discovered that (un)summon spell yet, while gw2 necromancers have.

### Game Design

- Two things come to mind when trying to recreate the unique feel of Guild Wars, and I don't see why we can't do both at once.

  1. Having many options available, but limited slots to choose from. In GW1 this was in both skills and attributes. Between 300+ skills and 200+ attribute points to spend, you had a lot of options to choose from. However, because you were limited to 8 skills and attribute point costs scaled logarithmically, all that available power quickly became hyper focused. In GW2 that moved to weapon choice, utility skills, and traits. Lots of total options that quickly get narrowed down.
  2. Situational skill synergies. GW1 was all about skill bar synergy. With 150 skills to choose for each profession, many were highly situational. You'd see these in skills with descriptions like "Deal +10 damage. If Target Foe is Burning, deal +15 damage and inflict Blindness". The best builds were ones that took advantage of creating and exploiting these situations. My favorite build to talk about is the [GW1 Touch Ranger](https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/Archive:R/N_Touch_Ranger). Both mechanically and thematically unique, it leveraged very specific mechanics to provide a self-sustaining combo.

  You've chosen to make this a supplement for 5e. I can see why you would so I'm not even going to question it. However, you will need to do some pretty hefty lifting. 5e as it stands isn't really ideal to replicate the two above points, but it can be done.

  - You'll need to scrap all classes. They just don't fit with what GW needs them to be. Now, this doesn't mean you'll need to create brand new ones from scratch. Instead, you'll just want to pick the most representative options to create a more focused experience. Dont be afraid to pull abilities from multiple classes if they fit the GW profession better (like pulling any archery abilities from Ranger, Fighter, Rogue, etc)
  - You'll want to scrap all subclasses as well. GW1's dual classing already covers the subclass concept, but you'll need to recreate from the ground up those as well. Fortunately, you can just use the classes you created as your base for subclasses. You should be able to just create a Main Class and Subclass version for each profession instead of needing to create every subclass for every main profession. Subclasses in GW1 were interchangeable just like Elite Specs in GW2.
  - You'll want to leverage situational feats, especially the weapon related ones that have appeared in UA. In both GW1 and 2, weapons and class features are locked to professions so you can afford to get really specific. I'd avoid the more generic feats and abilities if possible. Think of feats as traits and traitlines in GW2.
  - A big thing in GW1 specifically was skill hunting. Monsters used the same skills and sometimes the same builds as players, and you could tell which profession(s) they were. This also lead to a fun mechanic where you could go out in the world, kill a monster, and learn one of their skills (especially Elite Skills). You may want to consider reworking the Monster Manual so that enemies use the same tools as players, and specifically call out how each monster would work with specific professions. Monsters would generally be grouped in small squads, so that would help in encounter building.
  - You can keep things like skills and backgrounds as they are. Those mechanics weren't really a factor in GW1 or 2, but there's no negatives by keeping them. It's still an RPG and it still runs in 5e's engine.

### Giganticus Lupicus

I am currently working on a world conversion of GW (currently starting on Prophecies) and came across a small detail I'm trying to figure out between GW1 and GW2.

- On the [GW1 Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Giganticus_Lupicus), Giganticus Lupicus went extinct very early on, but no one appears to know anything about the extinction.
- On the [GW2      Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Great_Giant), Giganticus Lupicus are believed to have gone extinct because of the elder dragons.

This leads me to a few small assumptions, as I've not seen otherwise in my searching:

1. In the setting of GW1, nothing is known yet about the Giganticus Lupicus.
2. The only historical information that holds possible information to the Giganticus Lupicus is in ancient historical texts from the old races, and is not currently in public or shared knowledge.
3. By the time period of GW2, the Durmand Priory gets a bit more information and believes the Elder Dragons are the cause of the Giganticus Lupicus' extinction.

So - in order to be as faithful as possible to the lore, are my assumptions correct, or is there something I'm missing? Any help is greatly appreciated!

**Answer** by */u/Varorson*

In GW1, it's known that the Giganticus Lupicus died out ~10,000 BE. This comes from the timeline in the manuals and is more or less the sole GW1 lore on the Giganticus Lupicus.

In GW2, the Priory [believe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Stinn) (with some support [for](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Ruined_City_of_Arah_(explorable)#Jotun) [it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mursaat_Lore_Tablet) and [against](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bad_Blood#Dialogue) [it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Return_to_Camp_Resolve#Other_Dialogue)) that the Elder Dragons' last rising period was ~10,000 BE. There is also a risen Giganticus Lupicus from the previous dragonrise (fought in Arah explorable). So it's theorized in-universe that the Elder Dragons are what caused the Giganticus Lupicus' extinction (there are also [charr legends](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Myths_and_Legends_of_Ancient_Ascalon) that further this claim). It basically is a case of the Durmand Priory learning things (as in GW1, next to nothing was known about the Elder Dragons, especially to humans, but digging through forbidden dwarven texts, jotun stelae, charr legends, and Forgotten records - all of which unavailable to humans in GW1 - has led figuring these things out).

While generally what [u/sirjisu](https://www.reddit.com/u/sirjisu) said is true about GW1 and GW2 lore, but I wouldn't say "did the Elder Dragons kill the Giganticus Lupicus" is one of them. There are also quite a handful of cases where GW2 lore is a bit contradictory with itself, too. We know that the Elder Dragons were around while the GL were, but we don't know:

1. If that was the last awakening for sure (see contradictory lore in GW2; some sources, mainly around Glint and Forgotten, say 3,000 years while other sources, mainly from the Priory, says 10,000 years)
2. And if the Elder Dragons wiped them out, or if it's a case of correlation not causation with the timeframes.

### Gods

- The gods, though that's not truly hard: Balthazar gets the forge, light, and war domains; Dwayna gets arcana, life, and tempest, Grenth gets grave and death, Lyssa gets trickery, and Melandru gets nature (and druids).

### Races

#### In General

- a stab at a few of the races, although mostly just reskinning existing ones (e.g. Charr based mostly on Half-Orcs, for example), and I've had vague thoughts about the classes and such. I've always tried to keep my ideas focused around GW2 - for example, my Charr subraces were each of the four legions, so the Iron Legion would get firearm proficiency. However some more Guild Wars 1 ideas could be pretty interesting, especially as I've started playing that a bit more with the new updates.

  I think Human and Dwarf can pretty much come straight from D&D, maybe some slightly tweaks. Charr, Asura and Norn are also good picks. Other ones that could work, though: perhaps the Tengu? They’re enemies in Prophecies but in Factions there are plenty of friendly Tengu. You could stretch it and get the Forgotten or the Margonites too. I’ll have to give it some more thought.

#### Sylvari*

*These ideas will be reserved for GW2, as sylvari are a very new race.*

- Race sylvari:

  Wisdom +2, int +1 Profiencies: nature, survival Saving throws: wisdom, dex Languages: common, sylvan

  Racial ability commune with nature: players can use 10 minutes to commune with nature to figure about the area and surroundings.

  Racial ability 2: plant turrets. Once per long rest player can use their action to summon 2 plant turrets from the soil. Doesn't work indoors. Player can command the turrets to shoot using a bonus action. At level 10 they can instead summon a sylvari hound that stays with them until killed. The hound acts on their turn but doesn't require a bonus action. They can only control a hound or the turrets, not both.
