### Classes

#### Assassin

- **Assassin**: Rogue. however, compared to rogues, theyre less about thieving and all that stuff and more about damage. they could also be more magical than arcane tricksters, with their shadow steps and shadow magic. their big thing were their attack combos; from several Mainhand-, offhand- and dual-attacks you could build some really powerful chains. that part honestly sounds hard to translate into DnD combat. you dont really have the opportunity to hit the same target over several rounds that often.

  If i were to build the assassin i would probably use the rogue as the base chassis. then throw out all the thievery stuff, give them some form of shadow step and try to implement the combo mechanic somehow, perhaps as a replacement for or changed sneak attack. for example, at a certain level you pick some of several combos, all of which read like "if you do X as an action and Y as a bonus action, you can use your reaction to do Z" or something similar. move subclasses to lvl2 and have one of them be a shadow themed half caster.

#### Dervish

- **Dervish:** what an amazing, flavourful class; and after their rework, theyre pretty fun to play aswell. If paladins were cool, they would be Dervishes. while dervishes certainly have that zeal and holy powers, their magic was a lot more elemental in flavour and they werent as heavily armored. Dervishes could work as a paladin subclass, as clerics or somewhat as a reworked, reflavoured 4elements monk. their core mechanic were their enchantments, which they could manually remove to increase the effects of other abilities. Dervishes also stood out with their ability to turn into avatars of gods.

  As a custom class, i'd go with 1d10 or 1d8 hit points, wisdom half caster, light and medium armour, simple weapons, maybe all martial weapons or just a select few. plenty of holy, wind, earth and fire themed spells. their enchantment mechanic could be represented by buffs on yourself or just concentration. alternatively, give them a selection of self buffs to choose from, that they can use equal to their wisdom modifier per long rest. as a core feature dervishes then get a list of special actions which require a buff on yourself/your concentration, end that and then have an effect.

  **Elite specializations not accounted for:**

  Renegade/Mallyx (also warlock), Scrapper (artificer), Holosmith (maybe artificer or maybe some wacky barbarian), Deadeye (probably rogue), Tempest (Bard or Sorcerer). Reaper (anti-paladin?)

  **Also some side-note:**

  I came into several snags while trying to develop mechanical equivalents for the subclasses. Here's a list of them so far. I wanted to focus on making themes and mechanics feel very 5e, but just in a different universe.

  1. GW2's combat system is cooldown based, so figuring out how to translate this into power with spells and abilities is difficult. 5e relies heavily on once/time period mechanics, as giving every class spells doesn't make sense. Healing is also a really tough one, because GW2 healing tends to be more healing over time based, whereas 5e only has a concept of burst heal.
  2. Conditions are something difficult to translate over. I toyed with a simple condition system of injury/regeneration, (flat healing/damage per turn), protection/vulnerability (flat damage taken decrease/increase), might/weakness (flat outgoing damage increase/decrease). This would be an interesting way of buffing weapons with lower damage die by giving them conditions, to preserve that aspect of gameplay. However, I ultimately scrapped this as keeping track of these numbers was too complicated to feel 5e. I ended up with a system that avoids conditions and translate that into
  3. Guild wars elite specializations can fundamentally change a class. I originally toyed with the idea that an elite spec can be a choice that a class makes later on, but this turns out to be problematic because some skills that an elite specialization gives are super overpowered in a 5e setting (continuum split) and some would be incredibly underwhelming. I was also torn between making classes for each class, and then subclasses for each elite spec, but I felt that the more I toyed with this the further I deviated from 5e mechanically, and lost a lot of what makes 5e good.
  4. Engineer doesn't fit well into 5e, which is a class that is more steampunk/scifi than 5e's fantasy. You kinda need to use a new class to fit Engineer well. Luckily, we have Artificer
  5. Combos fields aren't a thing in 5e. A lot of things that normally relies on combo fields you have to get rid of.

  I settled on making subclasses: it was a perfect balance of maintaining 5. My short term goal is to make a Guild Wars 2 elite specialization for each main class in 5e, and also homebrew Races. Here's my plans thus far: some are far more fleshed out than others. Note for warlock, I combined mechanics of an elite spec with it's commonly used supporting invocation.

- Technically secondaries can work in the 5e system with an overhaul of multi-class rules. Example being removal of attribute restriction for lvl 1 to multi class, but higher levels might have requirements to emulate GW1 attribute system.

  Monk and Dervish would both be roughly analogous to the Cleric/Paladin classes, with devotion to a specific God as a requirement - not exactly the case for Monks in Guild Wars, but certainly for Dervishes.

  Ritualists are an interesting case in that there is very little in the existing 5e classes that could be adapted for them. The reliance on Souls rather than fleshy constructs is great material for a homebrew though, excited to see how this fleshes out.

  Bard would be a suitable mesmer class, or Bladesinger wizard might work too.  An enchantment and illusions based gish of sorts. *that playstyle only focuses on the illusion magic which gw2 did and it made the mesmer feels very one dimensional.*

  I agree about monks being clerics specifically healing/protection and war gods but the Dervish is a mixed bag in my opinion. If anything I think it'd require being a subclass that is more concentration spell focused (example being able to concentrate on more than 1 spell but much shorter duration  and the ability to purge them for extra effect, etcs)

  The only problem I have with a warlock/bard/tricky wizard for mesmers is that it only covers the illusion side of the meaner magic. It doesn't fit any flavour towards their use of signets, their multitude of stances, the ability to drain mana/spells or being a magic mimic.

  I think there is room to take them into a more interesting role than just "illusion mage" like gw2 made them.

- I think the subclass system in 5e would cover *most* of the dual class options as they are in GW1 (I loved that game), though some gaps might exist. Where I'd focus:

  Figuring out the Mesmer. It's probably a bard, but might need its own college.

  Tweaking the options for necromancers, including finding ways for minion masters to work.

  Cleric-monks. I'd probably start with cleric, and swap out heavy armor for martial arts, but that needs balancing.

  */u/jmartkdr*

- First thing you're going to want to do, in my opinion, is you're going to need to distinguish the nomenclature.

  - Example: D&D already has a "Thief" archetype. So, something like "Tyrian Thief" is necessary, even if you dislike the added wordage.

  ------

  The other big thing is, unlike the other reply in the comments, I'm less inclined to think you can just adapt any given class and map it to an existing class as a subclass.

  Guild Wars 2 professions have defining mechanics that are important for the feel of the class. Ideally, if time permits, you want to build them from the ground up.

  - Thief has their Shadowstep (and Deadeye's mark is somewhat similar to Hex or Hunter's Mark, yet is very different still).
  - Warrior has their Adrenaline mechanic (which is nothing like Action Surge or Rage)
  - Guardian has their Virtues (which are nothing like Paladin's smite or Cleric's domain stuff)
  - Ranger resembles Beastmaster, except you can collect a whole band of beasts and swap them regularly?

  Hopefully that gets the idea across. It's just not that simple.

  You can use D&D's classes for reference, such as what hit die to use (Warrior and Necromancer gets 1d12s, while Thief gets 1d8), but if you really want to get the feel of GW2 into the game, you need to identify some defining builds and try to make them work as standalone classes that can have their own subclasses.

  Example - Necromancer:

  - Shroud Transformation as a base feature - Already very different from a Wizard from School of Necromancy
  - Standard subclass - Minion Master
  - Reaper: Increased crit range to 19, focuses on melee. Has a feature with heavy-weapon synergy to emulate Greatsword's Gravedigger swing.
  - Scourge: Lots of sand-stuff and a feature that grants you and allies temporary hit points (barrier)

  */u/JunWasHere*

- two different names per combination (i.e N/W and W/N) might prove confusing and/or difficult.

  */u/Rotvoid*

- what it we created a class. its bassically the only playable class in this setting. but hear me out call it something like "the ascended" its primary feature is that at level 1 you choose a "primary" class, say fighter. you get all the same things a fighter does. then at level 2 you get a "secondary" class, say paladin but you get its lvl 1 benefits minus one core thing (like the core skill in GW). so its kinda like free multiclassing, in a way. which is bassically what GW does. but the secondary is nerfed so that the primary choice is relevant

  so like, say i wanted to be a 5e Monk/Fighter  my character level is lvl 7. so as the ascended class, you are essentially Monk 7 Fighter 3 (character lvl divided by 2 round down) you get all of the core monk traits. and all of the core Fighter traits except second wind (which i think is the thing that sets fighters most apart from others.   i think we would have to exclude subclasses from the secondary, so you couldnt be like, way of the drunken fist/battlemaster. but you would be way of the drunken fist, plus second wind, puls weapon/armor proficiencies etc

  or we could keep the subclasses from the secondary, just nerf them a bit. so that we dont have PCs too OP

  so by end game, you are essentially Monk 20 Fighter 10 but the fighter part is nerfed slightly so that you dont really feel like a lvl 30 character, but more than likely stronger than a lvl 20 character in 5e

#### Mesmer

- **Mesmer**: abjurer, illusionist and enchanters fit them well. bard, especially Lore bard with cutting words and counterspell+dispel magic at lvl6, fit them even better. honestly, mesmers seem rather easy and well to make in default DnD, with its wealth of fitting spells. tho im not sure whether mesmers really need bard songs or expertise or light armour proficiency.

  */u/rashandal*

- Gonna have to look more into this when I get time. Having Domination Mesmer spells that cost the target health for attempting an action (Backfire and Empathy) in D&D sounds absolutely amazing, as does Diversion.

  */u/The_Stuey*

#### Necromancer

- I wanted to explain why gw1 necros need corpses to create minions, while gw2 just summon them. It's not just a gameplay mechanic, since we have seen NPCs (like Trahearn) summon minions. So I went like this:

  Necromancers still need a corpse to create a minion, though more experienced necromancers can unsummon a minion they have already created and summon it again later when they need it on the battle. So, necromancers can either use a corpse on a battle to summon a minion, or must have already made one and summon it. In this idea, necromancers of the gw1 age haven't discovered that (un)summon spell yet, while gw2 necromancers have.

  */u/DrFelis*

- **Necromancer**: well, theres obviously the wizard necromancer. however the guild wars necromancer was much more diverse. you had blood magic to directly hurt enemies and steal their life, heal, buff and replenish your allies; curses to weaken your enemies, make them hurt themselves and protect your allies; death magic to deal raw damage and summon undead minions. one of their strengths and core aspects was their energy managment via soul reaping: as long as stuff died now and then, you didnt run out of energy. throw in minions that eventually die aswell for the same effect and it was actually difficult to run out of energy, even when you tried.

  The other core aspect was sacrifice. Necromancy is the magic of aggression and with i think one exception (hexer's vigor), every necromancer spell either hurt someone or required someone to be hurt/killed to have an effect.

  As a class, Wizard works decently well to emulate the guild wars necromancer. they certainly have enough spells for debuffing, necrotic damage, minions, buffing and even very fitting healing in the form of Life Transference. for a custom class, i'd make the necro a full caster, 1d8 hit points, no armour proficiencies and as core mechanics a) a custom resource they gain when someone in a certain radius is hurt and b) life sacrifice when casting. either optional, so that it increases spell effects or simply in the form of custom spells with some self hurt built in. come to think of it, both of these concepts could work as sorcerer/sorcery points.

  */u/rashandal*

#### Paragon

- I think you should try retooling bard into paragon.  I'm no 5e expert, so I can't give specifics - but it should have heavy armor and ranged attacks.  Making chants, shouts, and echoes would really add depth to the class.

  */u/refugeeinaudacity*

#### Ritualist

- for ritualist, theres healing spirit as a spell and shepherd druid for inspiration.

  */u/rashandal*

- ritualist as I would feel it could be super unique with spirits as a way to do damage or generate heals and use the summoned spirits as like a resource to do that.

### Game Design

- Two things come to mind when trying to recreate the unique feel of Guild Wars, and I don't see why we can't do both at once.

  1. Having many options available, but limited slots to choose from. In GW1 this was in both skills and attributes. Between 300+ skills and 200+ attribute points to spend, you had a lot of options to choose from. However, because you were limited to 8 skills and attribute point costs scaled logarithmically, all that available power quickly became hyper focused. In GW2 that moved to weapon choice, utility skills, and traits. Lots of total options that quickly get narrowed down.
  2. Situational skill synergies. GW1 was all about skill bar synergy. With 150 skills to choose for each profession, many were highly situational. You'd see these in skills with descriptions like "Deal +10 damage. If Target Foe is Burning, deal +15 damage and inflict Blindness". The best builds were ones that took advantage of creating and exploiting these situations. My favorite build to talk about is the [GW1 Touch Ranger](https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/Archive:R/N_Touch_Ranger). Both mechanically and thematically unique, it leveraged very specific mechanics to provide a self-sustaining combo.

  You've chosen to make this a supplement for 5e. I can see why you would so I'm not even going to question it. However, you will need to do some pretty hefty lifting. 5e as it stands isn't really ideal to replicate the two above points, but it can be done.

  - You'll need to scrap all classes. They just don't fit with what GW needs them to be. Now, this doesn't mean you'll need to create brand new ones from scratch. Instead, you'll just want to pick the most representative options to create a more focused experience. Dont be afraid to pull abilities from multiple classes if they fit the GW profession better (like pulling any archery abilities from Ranger, Fighter, Rogue, etc)
  - You'll want to scrap all subclasses as well. GW1's dual classing already covers the subclass concept, but you'll need to recreate from the ground up those as well. Fortunately, you can just use the classes you created as your base for subclasses. You should be able to just create a Main Class and Subclass version for each profession instead of needing to create every subclass for every main profession. Subclasses in GW1 were interchangeable just like Elite Specs in GW2.
  - You'll want to leverage situational feats, especially the weapon related ones that have appeared in UA. In both GW1 and 2, weapons and class features are locked to professions so you can afford to get really specific. I'd avoid the more generic feats and abilities if possible. Think of feats as traits and traitlines in GW2.
  - A big thing in GW1 specifically was skill hunting. Monsters used the same skills and sometimes the same builds as players, and you could tell which profession(s) they were. This also lead to a fun mechanic where you could go out in the world, kill a monster, and learn one of their skills (especially Elite Skills). You may want to consider reworking the Monster Manual so that enemies use the same tools as players, and specifically call out how each monster would work with specific professions. Monsters would generally be grouped in small squads, so that would help in encounter building.
  - You can keep things like skills and backgrounds as they are. Those mechanics weren't really a factor in GW1 or 2, but there's no negatives by keeping them. It's still an RPG and it still runs in 5e's engine.

### Giganticus Lupicus

I am currently working on a world conversion of GW (currently starting on Prophecies) and came across a small detail I'm trying to figure out between GW1 and GW2.

- On the [GW1 Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Giganticus_Lupicus), Giganticus Lupicus went extinct very early on, but no one appears to know anything about the extinction.
- On the [GW2      Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Great_Giant), Giganticus Lupicus are believed to have gone extinct because of the elder dragons.

This leads me to a few small assumptions, as I've not seen otherwise in my searching:

1. In the setting of GW1, nothing is known yet about the Giganticus Lupicus.
2. The only historical information that holds possible information to the Giganticus Lupicus is in ancient historical texts from the old races, and is not currently in public or shared knowledge.
3. By the time period of GW2, the Durmand Priory gets a bit more information and believes the Elder Dragons are the cause of the Giganticus Lupicus' extinction.

So - in order to be as faithful as possible to the lore, are my assumptions correct, or is there something I'm missing? Any help is greatly appreciated!

**Answer** by */u/Varorson*

In GW1, it's known that the Giganticus Lupicus died out ~10,000 BE. This comes from the timeline in the manuals and is more or less the sole GW1 lore on the Giganticus Lupicus.

In GW2, the Priory [believe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Stinn) (with some support [for](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Ruined_City_of_Arah_(explorable)#Jotun) [it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mursaat_Lore_Tablet) and [against](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bad_Blood#Dialogue) [it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Return_to_Camp_Resolve#Other_Dialogue)) that the Elder Dragons' last rising period was ~10,000 BE. There is also a risen Giganticus Lupicus from the previous dragonrise (fought in Arah explorable). So it's theorized in-universe that the Elder Dragons are what caused the Giganticus Lupicus' extinction (there are also [charr legends](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Myths_and_Legends_of_Ancient_Ascalon) that further this claim). It basically is a case of the Durmand Priory learning things (as in GW1, next to nothing was known about the Elder Dragons, especially to humans, but digging through forbidden dwarven texts, jotun stelae, charr legends, and Forgotten records - all of which unavailable to humans in GW1 - has led figuring these things out).

While generally what [u/sirjisu](https://www.reddit.com/u/sirjisu) said is true about GW1 and GW2 lore, but I wouldn't say "did the Elder Dragons kill the Giganticus Lupicus" is one of them. There are also quite a handful of cases where GW2 lore is a bit contradictory with itself, too. We know that the Elder Dragons were around while the GL were, but we don't know:

1. If that was the last awakening for sure (see contradictory lore in GW2; some sources, mainly around Glint and Forgotten, say 3,000 years while other sources, mainly from the Priory, says 10,000 years)
2. And if the Elder Dragons wiped them out, or if it's a case of correlation not causation with the timeframes.

### Gods

- The gods, though that's not truly hard: Balthazar gets the forge, light, and war domains; Dwayna gets arcana, life, and tempest, Grenth gets grave and death, Lyssa gets trickery, and Melandru gets nature (and druids).

### Maps

#### In General

- In an actual pen and paper RPG, I wouldn't worry too much about making "zones".  There shouldn't be much need to subdivide things that much, and you don't need to worry about arbitrary blocking borders like a videogame zone requires with hills/mountains always at the edge.  The only meaningful borders you need are the Great Northern Wall for obvious reasons (with its various breached areas) and the start of the Shiverpeaks to the west where it's perfectly fine to have just the one pass northwest from Nolani to proceed.

  Beyond that, let Ascalon be Ascalon.  The major points can be where they are, but it's not that important for you to distinguish between Old Ascalon and Regent Valley, or between The Breach and Diessa Lowlands.  And if your players walk west while south of the wall from Ascalon City to reach Rin directly, more power to them, just because the game doesn't let you (because Rin is meant to be accessed only when it's being attacked in the Nolani mission) that doesn't mean that the players shouldn't be able to in an RPG.

  The only thing you should need to do as a DM is note the different creature types in the different regions.  In most cases, that should simply be "the farther northwest you go, the more Charr encounters there are".  With the added effects of "there's unusual enemies in Dragon's Gullet if the players go up there for some reason" and "there's also Hydras up closer to the Shiverpeaks".  Beyond noting those encounter trends and whatever story-related happenings you plan to give the players, there shouldn't be much need to subdivide Ascalon, or other GW regions, into "zones".

- a stab at a few of the races, although mostly just reskinning existing ones (e.g. Charr based mostly on Half-Orcs, for example), and I've had vague thoughts about the classes and such. I've always tried to keep my ideas focused around GW2 - for example, my Charr subraces were each of the four legions, so the Iron Legion would get firearm proficiency. However some more Guild Wars 1 ideas could be pretty interesting, especially as I've started playing that a bit more with the new updates.

  I think Human and Dwarf can pretty much come straight from D&D, maybe some slightly tweaks. Charr, Asura and Norn are also good picks. Other ones that could work, though: perhaps the Tengu? They’re enemies in Prophecies but in Factions there are plenty of friendly Tengu. You could stretch it and get the Forgotten or the Margonites too. I’ll have to give it some more thought.

#### Sylvari*

*These ideas will be reserved for GW2, as sylvari are a very new race.*

- Race sylvari:

  Wisdom +2, int +1 Profiencies: nature, survival Saving throws: wisdom, dex Languages: common, sylvan

  Racial ability commune with nature: players can use 10 minutes to commune with nature to figure about the area and surroundings.

  Racial ability 2: plant turrets. Once per long rest player can use their action to summon 2 plant turrets from the soil. Doesn't work indoors. Player can command the turrets to shoot using a bonus action. At level 10 they can instead summon a sylvari hound that stays with them until killed. The hound acts on their turn but doesn't require a bonus action. They can only control a hound or the turrets, not both.

### Spells and Abilities

#### In General

- Also love the idea of working in Deep Wounds as a condition (mostly played warrior), though I'm guessing D&D exhaustion  mechanics has something similar already.

  Distracting Shot/Chop vs spells with somatic components also sounds neat, though potentially difficult to balance.
