# The Beasts of Guild Wars

This section aims to contain all the beasts players can expect to find in the world within Guild Wars. Essentially, this will be "the bestiary."

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Creature_type

> This is going to be one hell of a section - lots of areas and effort to determine which differences to include and ignore. However, some of these creatures are similar to non-GW creatures, which could enable us to save some time.

## Notes

### Levels

In GW, players hit max level at 20 - similar to 5e. However, monsters were allowed to go all the way up to level 42! This makes things tough to determine how to go about balancing. Luckily, "The Angry GM" makes some very good notes on how to build custom monsters. For many monsters, it might be easier to take the level, divide by 2, and round down. But do this at a case by case basis.

### Resources

This will include a list of useful sites to use to create creature blocks and reskins (for certain monsters).

## Facet

The Facets are a kind of ghostly servants of the [gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria). All of the known Facets take the form of a semi-transparent [dragon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dragon).  However, there are more Facets than have been observed and it is currently unknown if they all take the same form. 

The Facets encountered in the [Tarnished Coast](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tarnished_Coast) and during [The Path to Revelations](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Path_to_Revelations) are said to "reflect the nature of the power that the human gods have harnessed"[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Facet#cite_note-1) and are "[ghostly](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ghost) servants" that are "tied to the [Forgotten](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Forgotten)."[[2\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Facet#cite_note-2) It is unknown if the Facets encountered in the [Dragon's Lair](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair) are the same.

## Forgotten

The Forgotten are a group of ancient snake-like beings that stand upright. It is said that they were placed on the world of [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)) in 1769 [BE](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mouvelian_calendar) by the [Six Gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria) in order to guide the other races. They originally resided all over Tyria. At an unknown time before 100 BE, the Forgotten were at war with the [Charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr) on the border of what would become [Ascalon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascalon), near the [Blazeridge Mountains](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blazeridge_Mountains). In 0 BE, the Forgotten aided the Five Gods in their war against [Abaddon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Abaddon) and acted as wardens of the defeated god and his army within the [Realm of Torment](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Realm_of_Torment) - where they continued this duty until [Nightfall](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nightfall_(event)) occurred in 1075 AE. 

When [humans](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human) appeared in [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) and began to become the superior race, the Forgotten retreated to the [Crystal Desert](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert). In the Crystal Desert, they now serve the [dragon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dragon) [Glint](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Glint), where their race have become long forgotten, hence their current name. Alongside guarding Glint, they act as the testers in the trials of [Ascension](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascension), posing as a threat to all who wish to become Ascended. When [Turai Ossa](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Turai_Ossa) and the [Elonians](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elona) ventured into the Crystal Desert, they immediately attacked the Forgotten thinking them to be mindless beasts - and were soon wiped out, by both the Forgotten's retaliation and internal strife. 

The Forgotten are said to be linked to the [Facets](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Facet) that reflect the power of the Human Gods.

Before [the Searing](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Searing) in Ascalon, Gargoyles mainly dwelt in [the Catacombs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Catacombs).

## Ghost

Most restless souls of formerly living [creatures](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Creature) have some sort of reason for hanging around a place: an unfinished task, a wrong that needs righting, and so on. They're often coherent, and you can hold a reasonable conversation with them—the few not eager to have you join them, at least. They can be obsessive, or angry, but they're sane—sane for ghosts, at least. They can be recognized by their translucent appearance and their typically greenish [skins](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Skin). Almost all ghosts are non-[fleshy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fleshy), i.e. they are invulnerable to certain [conditions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Condition) and leave invisible non-exploitable [corpses](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Corpse).

## Giant

Giants are grotesquely formed humanoids that are larger than [humans](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human). They are sentient, but communicate using primitive language skills. They are found using just three professions: warriors, rangers, or necromancers. All Giants appear to have horns protruding from either their jaw, forehead, or the top of their skull. 

Every Giant has [Giant Stomp](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Giant_Stomp) and except for those found in [The Desolation](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Desolation) all have [immunity to knock down](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Stun_Immunity). Some giants can cause [knock down on critical hits](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Stun_on_Critical_Hit).

## Grawl

The Grawl are humanoid [creatures](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Creature_type) roaming [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) from the [Charr Homelands](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr_Homelands) to the southern areas of the [Shiverpeak Mountains](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains). This species has an ape like physique and seems to possess a primitive form of culture with a social hierarchy and different professions. 

While the Grawl are seen fighting beside the [Charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr) quite often, there is no clear evidence that they are allies. The only sign of organized cooperation between the two was working alongside [Vatlaaw Doomtooth](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vatlaaw_Doomtooth) and later an attempt to form an alliance by [Torch Harrowkeeper](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Torch_Harrowkeeper). [Galton Franks](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Galton_Franks), a collector for the Ebon Vanguard, seems to believe that *"the grawl are either proto-Charr or, more likely, an important source of Charr nutrition"*. 

While the exact nature of their religious beliefs are unknown, [Durmand](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Durmand) believes that their necklaces hold some evidence for their religious tendencies. Along with that, the Grawl seem to congregate at a few locations with statues to the [Gods of Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria) - such as at [Melandru](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Melandru)'s statue at [King's Watch](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/King%27s_Watch), [Lyssa](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lyssa)'s statue outside the [Ruins of Surmia](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ruins_of_Surmia_(outpost)) outpost, and outside the [Temple of Grenth](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Temple_of_Grenth). 

In [Regent Valley](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Regent_Valley), there are groups of Grawl who fight each other: the [Grawl Petitioners](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Grawl_Petitioner) and [Grawl Heretics](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Grawl_Heretic). These two groups indicate a form of civil or religious split.

## Griffon

Griffons are four-legged winged creatures that can be found in either locations of extreme heat, like deserts, or extreme cold, such as high up in the mountains. 

There are many depictions of griffons throughout [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) and [Elona](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elona), though these depictions often show the Griffons with feathered wings while they actually have bat-like wings.

--------------

## Human

Humans are one of the most widespread and influential [species](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Species) in the world of [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)). They are spread throughout the world of Tyria, including [Cantha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cantha), [Elona](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elona), and the eponymous continent [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria), though it is implied they live further south than Cantha, which is where they may have originated.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-Kill_Ten_Rats-1) 

Wherever they originated, humans are not native to the world as they were brought there by the [Six Gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria).[[2\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-2) The gods themselves only predate humans by a short period of time.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-Kill_Ten_Rats-1)

## Hydra

Hydras are large three-headed reptilian [creatures](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Creature_type) that can be found throughout [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) and the [Fissure of Woe](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fissure_of_Woe).

## Imp

## Jade Construct

Jade constructs are [constructs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Construct) created by the [Mursaat](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mursaat). Though they are called 'jade', most of them are not green like jade is, but bear the purplish color of most Mursaat artifacts and constructions. Like all constructs, they are not [fleshy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fleshy).

## Minotaur

*An old folk legend states the only reason* [Dolyaks](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dolyak) *were domesticated instead of* minotaurs *is because minotaurs would rather be beaten to death than obey a command. Dolyaks, simply put, were less stubborn. Minotaurs are one of the oldest species in* [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) *and are very much prized by the* [Norn](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Norn) *for their warm, furry coats. They were once extremely populous throughout the Shiverpeaks but now reside solely in the northern regions, where they have sheltered valleys and caves to make their homes.*

## Mursaat

The Mursaat, also known as **"The Unseen Ones"**, are a race of floating [humanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humanoid) [spellcasters](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spellcaster). They have the ability to hide themselves from those who do not have the [gift of True Sight](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gift_of_True_Sight) and are considered the deities of the White Mantle religion. In appearence, they have several long wings that allow them to float, three elongated toes, and golden armor and masks. They are often seen with their [jade construct](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Jade_construct) minions and  [towers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mursaat_tower). 

Not much is known of the Mursaat's history before the year 1070 [AE](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mouvelian_calendar), other than that they predate [humanity](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human), alongside the [Dwarves](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dwarf) and [Seers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Seer).[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mursaat#cite_note-1) In the time before the [gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria) brought humans to [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)), the Mursaat and the Seers were sworn enemies, with the Mursaat having emerged victorious in the last war between the two races.

## Nightmare

Nightmares are creatures that appear as shadow-like creatures, though there seems to be two kinds of Nightmares. Some Nightmares seem to come from [The Mists](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Mists). On the other hand, there are Nightmares which seem to be hostile spirits, such as the ones encountered during the quest [Haunted](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Haunted) and the [Vaettirs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vaettir) such as [Nulfastu Earthbound](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nulfastu_Earthbound), a fallen nature spirit that entraps other spirits (that take the shape of Vaettirs).

## Ogre

An ogre is a [type of creature](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Creature_type) that is humanoid in appearance. Considered a diminutive race of lesser giants distantly related to [Giganticus Lupicus](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Giganticus_Lupicus), but still significantly large when compared to [humans](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human) and [norn](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Norn). Although socially intelligent and sentient, they are primitives. Ogres are either warriors or indirect casters, such as necromancers and mesmers. The various sorts include [Ettins](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ettin), [Yetis](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Yeti), and [Jotun](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Jotun). 

Weapons that deal extra damage to ogres include: The [Ogre-Slaying Knife](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ogre-Slaying_Knife) and any weapon with an [of Ogreslaying](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Of_slaying) upgrade.

## Plant

Sentient plants are any kind of moving plant - including roots, bushes, flowers, and trees - that can be encountered on every continent. [Oakhearts](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Oakheart) have the same appearance of [nature rituals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nature_ritual), [Melandru's Watcher](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Melandru%27s_Watcher), and the [Druids](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Druid), in a non-transparent form. 

What make certain plants sentient and others not is due to mutations caused by an excessive amount of [magic](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Magic) in the area as shown in [Unnatural Growths](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Unnatural_Growths) and [A Bushel of Trouble](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/A_Bushel_of_Trouble).

## Rider

Riders are unnatural floating beings that can be found throughout [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) and in the [Fissure of Woe](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fissure_of_Woe). The ancient power-mad mage known as [Sybitha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Sybitha) is said to have "unleashed" the Riders within the [Crystal Desert](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert), implying that the Riders may originate from [the Mists](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Mists).  [Erudine](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Erudine) has been conducting experiments on them ever since they appeared after [the Searing](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Searing). They seem to be attracted to locations of magic, as they can be found in locations which have either suffered from magical events, have bloodstones, or show magical qualities.

## Seer

The Seers are an ancient powerful and still mysterious race of genderless floating beings.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Seer#cite_note-1) Not much is known about them still, though their race already had a functional society and civilization by the time the [gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria) brought [humanity](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human) to [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)). Their race dates back to the writing of the [Tome of Rubicon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tome_of_Rubicon), during which they were in a war with the [Mursaat](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mursaat). At some point in time, they had found a defense against the Mursaat's [agonizing touch](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spectral_Agony) but were still defeated. 

The war itself did not annihilate the race, but rather their race was reduced over time after the war. The remains of their civilization can be seen today, though those who find it do not know what they are.[[2\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Seer#cite_note-2)

## Scarab

Scarabs are large four-legged insect like creatures found throughout [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) in the [Maguuma Jungle](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Maguuma_Jungle) and [Crystal Desert](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert). Scarabs are attracted to areas of large deaths, indicating that they are carrion feeders. Some Scarabs are known to even devour [souls](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ghost). 

During [Wintersday](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Wintersday), the [Humbug](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Humbug), a kind of Scarab, assists the [Grentches](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Grentch) in their efforts to to aid [Grenth](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Grenth).

*Not an actual creature, but listed under "creature types." Perhaps a joke creature for TTRPG?*

## Skale

Although apparently primitive creatures, the skale (at least those in [Istan](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Istan)) worship a powerful ancient skale by the name of [Moa'vu'Kaal](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Moa%27vu%27Kaal). The Istani skales are also known to have a lord, [Jurpa](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Skale_Lord_Jurpa). There are some cases of [Istani Cultists](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Istani_Cultist) that seem to worship the skales as well.

## Skeleton

Skeletons are a creature type of the [undead](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Undead) affiliation. [Holy damage](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Holy_damage) is doubled against all skeleton. Some of them have -20 [AR](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Armor_rating) against [blunt damage](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blunt_damage) and +20 AR against [piercing damage](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Piercing_damage). Since they are just a pile of animated bones, they are not [fleshy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fleshy).

## Snowman

Snowmen are servants of [Dwayna](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dwayna) who are made by children. Their purpose is to spread holiday cheer on [Wintersday](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Wintersday) and to stop [Grenth](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Grenth)'s minions, the [grentches](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Grentch), from ruining Wintersday. Every year when they are no longer needed, they retreat to the [Secret Lair of the Snowmen](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Secret_Lair_of_the_Snowmen) until they are once again called upon by Dwayna.

## Spirit

Spirits are a type of [summoned creature](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Summoned_creature) that are created by [Rituals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ritual), certain [monster skills](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Monster_skill), or that appear as a hostile [creature](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Creature) during particular [missions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mission), [quests](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Quest), or in the [Depths of Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Depths_of_Tyria). In addition, the [PvE](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Player_versus_Environment) version of [Signet of Spirits](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Signet_of_Spirits) creates 3 spirits. 

Only two professions have skills that can summon these [NPCs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Non-player_character): [Rangers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ranger) (through [Nature rituals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nature_ritual)) and [Ritualists](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ritualist) (through [Binding rituals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Binding_ritual)). The only other ritual available to players is the [Ebon Vanguard skill](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ebon_Vanguard_rank), [Winds](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Winds). A small number of [foes](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Foe) have specific skills for summoning spirits, such as [Kuunavang](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kuunavang)'s [Corrupted Dragon Scales](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Corrupted_Dragon_Scales). 

Although [ghosts](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ghost) also have translucent green, blue, or purple skins, they belong to a different [creature type](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Creature_type) and have very different characteristics, regardless of their name.

## Tengu

Tengu *are a unique* [species](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Species) *of avian humanoids found in both* [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) *and* [Cantha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cantha)*. Females are generally larger than males of the species, though their plumage is plainer, even drab. Tengu lost the ability of flight some time in the distant past, but can use their almost human hands to wield all manner of weapons—when they want to. Their talons make most weapons superfluous. Tengu hate cooked food, and most live on a diet of fresh, raw meat.*

## Worm

Worms are burrowing creatures which are smaller, less aggressive versions of [wurms](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Wurm) and even look exactly like their [larvae](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Frost_Larvae) state. Unlike Wurms, they can not move while under the surface and do not cause [knock down](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Knock_down) when they pop up. 

Worms are usually quite harmless unless attacked, with the exception being Rock Borer Worms.

## Wurm

Wurms are giant [worm](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Worm)-like [creatures](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Creature_type) that burrow through the ground. Some wurms are able to use [extended ranged "siege" attacks](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Wurm_Siege). They are generally larger, more aggressive versions of [worms](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Worm). The [larvae](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Frost_Larvae) state even resembles worms.
