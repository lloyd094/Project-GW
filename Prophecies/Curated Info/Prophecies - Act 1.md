# Prophecies - Act 1

## Act 1: A Kingdom in Despair

### Story Arc

*Once, Ascalon was a beautiful, fertile land of rolling green countryside and magnificent cities. Her people were viewed as grim by their neighbors. This was perhaps, to be expected, given their never-ending war against the aggressive Charr. Indeed, it was their unfailing vigilance, their Great Northern Wall, and the blood they shed each year to defend it that had protected not only Ascalon, but also Kryta and Orr through the ages.*

*Then came the invasion, and with it, the Searing.*

*Anyone alive today will remember the day the lands of Ascalon were blasted and torn with magic fire. Whole cities and guilds were destroyed in the Searing, and the might of Ascalon was shattered. Now the Great Northern Wall lies broken, and the Charr have overrun much of the kingdom, defiling it with their unholy shrines, killing those who stand in their way.*

*The survival of Ascalon hinges on but a single remaining corner of the fallen kingdomâ€”the capital city of Rin. In the final years of the last Guild War, the people of Rin looked to a soldier named Adelbern, a simple man of humble origins, who rallied the people with his courage and cunning and steeled them not only against the guilds of Orr and Kryta but also against the terrors of the Charr.*

*The sudden destruction of most of the kingdom during the Searing has taken much of the fight out of the man now known as King Adelbern. He has become stubborn and set in his ways, afraid of losing what little he has left. But in his son Rurik, the people see a leader with the courage to perhaps help them reclaim their fallen kingdom.*

*The survivors of Ascalon live in a state of constant warfare, using hit-and-run tactics and the remnants of the Great Wall to prevent any significant advances by the Charr into their territory. King Adelbern has circled the wagons, so to speak, content to simply defend what Ascalon has left and live to fight another day. Prince Rurik, on the other hand, is far more daring than his father thinks is wise, and has even suggested that the time may be coming to launch an offensive against the Charr.*

*Already the rumbling of the winds of change can be heard in the streets. People are frightened. They wonder what will become of them. Some even wonder aloud if Adelbern has lost what it takes to steer Ascalon back from the brink. They wish to see the prince step up and take command of the kingdom. Perhaps under his guidance, the people of Ascalon will live on to see another golden age.*

------

**Intro:** Following The Searing, the kingdom of Ascalon is in despair. Approximately two years later, Ascalon is still holding their ground against the charr as much as possible, but the fight is going nowhere. Additionally, most of the settlements in Ascalon are now ruins. 

This Arc takes place entirely within Ascalon.

#### 1.1 - The Krytan Ambassador

**Synopsis:** The party has recently returned from a patrol, and has now been tasked with running errands and messages. The party will learn of some of the attitudes between Ascalon and Kryta, and may even meet with a Krytan Ambassador. *This mission is primarily a scene setting mission, building up background for the later parts of the story. This mission is optional, and may be skipped without any consequence.*

| Disc                            | *Blasted and battered, the current landscape of Ascalon holds only the ghost of its former glory. Skeletons of grand cathedrals and remnants of whole cities lie broken on the shifted, displaced ground. The protective Great Northern Wall is perhaps the most intact structure in the entire kingdom, but the destruction that surrounds it lies in testament to its ultimate failure.<br /><br />Before the Charr invasion and the Searing, Ascalon was a fertile land, full of wheat fields and blossoming flowers. Now though, little grows here in this wasteland. The once loamy earth is now dry and arid. The riverbeds have dried up, and the mudflats have turned into a patchwork of cracked plates and jagged scars in the ground.* |

The party has spent the last two years continuing to serve the army of Ascalon. Upon completion of a recent patrol ending outside the now ruined Ascalon City, they are approached by Captain Osric.

|      | Captain Osric                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"Welcome back! Looks like the patrol went well. You're still in one piece at any rate... Listen, Prince Rurik sent me to ask you a favor."*<br /><br />*You've been in the field, so you probably haven't heard about this, but an ambassador's arrived from our old enemy Kryta. They can help us fight the Charr, but the king won't even talk to him. The prince hasn't been able to make any headway with his father, but he knows the King trusts Tydus, and Tydus trusts you. Would you perhaps talk to Warmaster Tydus about this matter? He's in his usual place in Ascalon City."* |
| Ask  | *"I understand why the king bears a grudge against Kryta. He believes we might have been able to stop the Searing if we'd not spent so many years defending ourselves from Krytan guilds, but by all accounts, times have changed in Kryta. We should at least hear what the ambassador has to say. Please, next time you're in Ascalon City, talk to Warmaster Tydus about this. He trusts you. If you can convince him, he may be able to persuade the king to listen to reason."* |

After accepting the quest, Captain Osric thanks them and walks away to take care of other important matters. It would be best to speak with Tydus sooner than later, who may be found in Ascalon City.

| ![](..\Assets\Symbols\Ranger.png) | Warmaster Tydus                                              |
| :-------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|               Main                | *"Don't talk to me about that Krytan ambassador! I've been getting an earful from both sides. Do you know why King Adelbern trusts me? Because I know where my loyalties lie. King and country, Balthazar preserve them both! Perhaps joining the Prince's Vanguard has confused you, but Rurik is not the ruler of the kingdom. Now listen to me. The king's already given this matter much consideration, and the likes of you and I best abide by his wisdom."* |
|               Cont.               | *"I have an important task for you. Please deliver this royal message to Ambassador Zain of Kryta. His camp can be found just outside the city. Go out the western gate to Old Ascalon and head west to find the encampment."<br/><br />"I don't trust these Krytans. I want you to take someone with you in case there's trouble. I'm sure Alesia will be willing to go with you, and she can heal you if need be."* |

If the party asks to help, or the GM wants to add this as a quest, Tydus will assign the party the task of delivering the message. Tydus recommends the party meet with Alesia Baptiste*, a Tyrian monk who may act as a healer for the party. 

As the party ventures outside Ascalon City, they will head towards an encampment nearby. The encampment is located on top of a hill, and centered around an old dead tree. There is a fire burning, and if the party so chooses to listen, they will hear some dialogue between Prince Rurik and Ambassador Zain.

|       | Dialogue                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik | *"Greetings Ambassador Zain. Let me be the first to welcome you to Ascalon."* |
| Zain  | *"Ah, Prince Rurik. I thank you for your kind words. I will admit, I was nervous about this meeting. Our initial reception here in Ascalon City has been...less than warm."* |
| Rurik | *"So I have heard. I apologize for my father. He means well and does what he thinks is best for his country, but sometimes his stubborn memory of the last Guild War gets in his way."* |
| Zain  | *"The days of war between our two nations are over. We are here in the name of Kryta to give aid to Ascalon. We ask for nothing in return, and wish only to be of service."* |
| Rurik | *"We would be foolish to allow our pride to stand in the way of such a generous offer."* |
| Zain  | *"Now I see why the people of Ascalon so admire you, Rurik. When it is your turn, you will be a good king. A good king indeed."* |
| Rurik | *"Thank you, Ambassador. Now I must take my leave. I will talk with the king. Perhaps I can change his mind and gain you access to the city."* |

|      | Ambassador Zain                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Desc | Zain is an ambassador of Kryta and representative of the White Mantle. |
| Main | *"A message with the royal seal? Let's see. Honored Ambassador et cetera...et cetera..."Your request for permission to enter the city and address the people of Ascalon is emphatically denied. This being the fourth such denial, His Majesty bids you reconsider this ill-conceived journey and contemplate a return to Kryta.""<br/><br />"King Adelbern and I have learned very different lessons from the wars of past. Isolation is not the answer. Only in peace and mutual friendship shall we find our salvation. I still have hope that in time, he will realize the truth of this."* |
| Extr | <u>Kryta Status:</u> *"There is peace in Kryta. What more need you hear? The wisdom of men may fail. Place your faith in the Unseen Ones. Life is good for those sheltered by the White Mantle.*<br /><u>Thoughts Toward Ascalon:</u> *"The war between Kryta and Ascalon is over, and both kingdoms have been transformed. Old grudges have no place in this new world. It is time for there to be friendship between us once more."*<br /><u>White Mantle:</u> *The White Mantle serve the Unseen Ones who saved Kryta from the Charr invasion. We have brought peace and stability to the lands of the west. Our fields are no longer ruined by battle, and the ships that ply our ports bring trade, not warfare.*<br /><u>Why Are You Here:</u> *"Confessor Dorian, head of the White Mantle, has foreseen dire times for Ascalon. Troubled by these visions, he sent me, to offer King Adelbern our help in these dark days."* |
| Non  | If the party did not deliver the message to Ambassador Zain, he will simply respond with:<br />*"Please pardon me. It is not that I do not wish to speak with you, but I am on an important diplomatic mission here in Ascalon, and King Adelbern is very wary of foreigners. It might hinder my efforts to be seen talking to you. I hope you understand."* |

#### 1.2 - Defend the Wall

*Chapter Notes: There are plenty of locations that battles can be inserted - for here, the recommended creatures are devourers, gargoyles, and charr. The GM can also provide optional ways to get around certain challenges such as thinking outside the box, giving alternatives, etc.*

Sometime after delivering the message to Ambassador Zain, the group is approached once again by Warmaster Tydus.

|      | Warmaster Tydus                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"There you are! I was asked to pass you a message from Prince Rurik. There's trouble at the Great Northern Wall, and they'd like your help. Squire Zachery is waiting for you at the Wall.<br/><br />One thing before you go... Since Althea's disappearance, the prince has grown increasingly reckless. Be careful, old friend. Ascalon needs you in one piece."* |
| Loca | *"Forgotten how to get to the Great Northern Wall, have you? Head northeast and you'll find it. I believe Squire Zachery is already there, waiting for you."* |

As the group heads northeast from Ascalon City, they will find the Great Northern Wall outpost a short distance away. Inside, they will meet a young squire by name of Zachary, patiently waiting for the group to arrive.

|      | Squire Zachary                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"It's an honor to meet you all. I suppose you're wondering why Prince Rurik asked you here. I'm afraid I can't say, really. Captain Calhaan is in charge, and I'm not so important that they tell me anything, to be honest. I do know there's trouble ahead. You may want to gather some allies before going in to talk to the Captain. He's the sort to send you right into the fray, soon as he sees you."* |

The party will find Captain Calhaan nearby, who will brief them on the situation.

|      | Captain Calhaan                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"We fear the Charr General Bonfaaz Burntfur is planning a mass raid on the Wall. Head north into enemy territory and find out what that mangy beast has planned."* |

The party will then head down the wall's battlements into the northern lands. At the base of the wall are soldiers guarding the gate, some fighting off devourers who got too close. As the group heads north, they will pass devourers, gargoyles, and skirmishes between the two. Eventually to keep heading north, the party will have to get through a gate in some old ruins - there just happens to be some grawl nearby it. 

*Side Quest: Champion of Surmia*

Once past the gate, the party will climb a hill to overlook the charr army they were sent to find. Through one way or another, the Charr army spots the group and starts charging towards them. The group must make it back to the wall and warn Captain Calhaan.

|      | Captain Calhaan                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"You're back. Well done. What news of the Charr?"*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"There are too many - we'll never hold them off! The Wall is lost - we must fall back. Retreat and regroup at the bunkers just north of Fort Ranik. We can't let the Charr make it to the capital!"* |

The group will retreat with the Ascalonian forces to Fort Ranik, thus proceeding directly into the next arc. 

*The GM may wish to add challenges along the way or other optional content. The story continues in Fort Ranik however.*

----------

#### 1.3 - Fort Ranik

Following the escape from the Northern Wall, the army regroups in Fort Ranik. There, the party can find Lord Darrin. The following discussion may carry out:

|      | Lord Darrin                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | **"The Ascalon Army is scattered and in retreat. But small teams are regrouping and making stands against the invaders. If you can push back the Charr, force them out and retake the Wall, Ascalon City will be saved.""I've seen this sort of thing before, and it does not bode well, not at all. What is it you desire my friend?"*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"Today is a dark day in the history of Ascalon. The Charr have breached the Wall again. They burn our homes and threaten to take what little we have left. The guards who man the Wall have fallen back, and the Charr army marches on Ascalon City."*<br /><br />*"The Charr are beasts, but it appears they are not as stupid as many think. They organized a large invasion force and simply overwhelmed the garrison at the Northern Gate.<br/>Prince Rurik is directing an organized defense. Even now, he marches toward the Wall from the capital city of Rin. Even so, Rin is far to the west. By the time he arrives, Ascalon City may have already fallen."*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"Your words are inspiring, but I'm afraid the end of Ascalon is near. How long can we hold out against such a beastly race as the Charr? They have only one goal, and that is to see the end of us all. You've heard the rumors...even Prince Rurik thinks the time has come to abandon the cities and make for the mountain pass."*<br /><br />*"The Ascalon Army is scattered and in retreat. But small teams are regrouping and making stands against the invaders. If you can push back the Charr, force them out and retake the Wall, Ascalon City will be saved."*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"The events of the next few hours will either be written about in legend or torn from human memory by the claws of the Charr. The choice of which of these things comes to pass is up to you. Good luck."* |

By the end of the discussion, the group should be aware of their goal: to push back the Charr forces. The party will then head out when ready in effort to strike back.

Upon leaving Fort Ranik, the area will be a battlefield - burnt, bloody, and filled with debris. All around are Charr fighting against the Ascalonian forces. On their way north, the party may overhear some members of the militia announcing that the Charr have pushed past the cathedral, thus putting many Ascalonian citizens in danger.

*Side Quest: Deliver A Message To My Wife*

Eventually, the group will come to a hill overlooking a Charr infested valley before the wall. Around this area are Trebuchets, now broken. Near one of the trebuchets is an engineer attempting to repair, but he refuses to speak unless the surrounding area is safe. Once any threats in the immediate area are taken care of, the party can then speak with Siegemaster Lormar.

|      | Siegemaster Lormar                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"Damn Charr snuck up on me while I was repairing this trebuchet. It's missing a release lever, restraining bolt, and an arming crank. Search the other wrecked trebuchets to find those three pieces, and bring them back to me. If you do, we can fix this little lovely, and we'll give those Charr a taste of their own filth!"* |

After the party brings Siegemaster Lormar the required parts, he gets them in place and allows the party to load and fire (if they wish). This results in the death of the Charr party in the valley, making the way clear to get closer to the wall.

As the party moves closer to the wall, there is one more fight to take place: a Charr general and a small band of minions blocks your goal. *Smart players may notice a second trebuchet nearby that will decimate the group in this fight as well, speeding up the final part of the mission.* Once the general is destroyed, the party meets with the Ascalonian army to listen to a speech given by Prince Rurik.

|       | Prince Rurik's Speech                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik | *"The time for action has come. No more cowering behind this wall! From now on, we take the fight to our enemies!"* |
| Guard | *"Prince Rurik! Prince Rurik!"*                              |
| Rurik | *"What is it?"*                                              |
| Guard | *"We are victorious, but it has cost us greatly. During their retreat, the Charr took prisoners. Several of our wounded have been carried off!"* |
| Rurik | *"Ascalon will live in fear of these beasts no more. We march to the north, to free our brothers and take back that which has been taken from us."* |

-------

#### 1.4 - Ruins of Surmia

Following the speech by Rurik, the party is now able to speak with Warmaster Riga, found near Frontier Gate. There, he will tell them to head to Surmia to speak with Captain Miken.

|      | Warmaster Riga                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"You're another one of those Vanguard soldiers looking for Prince Rurik, aren't you? He didn't wait for you, but I think you still have a chance to catch up to him. The prince headed north to pursue the fleeing Charr into the ruins of Surmia. Follow the road from the Frontier Gate to Surmia to rejoin the prince and rescue those carried off by the Charr. I directed Captain Miken up that way not too long ago. He might be able to direct you further."* |
| Ask  | *"I admire Prince Rurik's courage, but chasing the Charr north of the Wall is a fool's errand, if you ask me. Not that you did ask me... If you want to find the prince, follow the road from the Frontier Gate to Surmia. Once there, check with Captain Miken for the prince's exact whereabouts."* |

Along the road towards Surmia, there are several groups of grawl that the party may choose to either engage in combat or sneak past. Once outside Surmia, the party can find Captain Miken who will instruct the party to assist Prince Rurik in a rescue mission.

|      | Captain Miken                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"You've arrived just in time. The prince has already begun scouting the path, and from what I can see, he is prepared to pursue the Charr on his own if need be. He asked that I remain in this area and direct everyone I can find to join him, and I am doing my best to carry out his orders.<br/><br />Please gather a force as quickly as you can and see if you can catch up with Prince Rurik before he tries to face the Charr army on his own!"* |

When the party is ready, they will find Prince Rurik waiting for them just outside the encampment. The mission is best split into three sections: before the drawbridge, the drawbridge, and after the drawbridge. The journey north into Surmia territory is dangerous, resulting in many devourer and charr encounters. Along the way, Rurik laments about how sad it is to see Ascalon in ruins.

In the first section, the party will come across three different charr encampments, each with prisoners that Rurik will want to free and send back towards the wall. For the third encampment, the party will meet Errol, and the following conversation will take place.

|       | Dialogue                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik | *"Gods! How long have you been out here, man?"*              |
| Erol  | *"I don't know. Since my unit was taken at the end of the last Guild War. Since the sky rained fire and destroyed Ascalon."* |
| Rurik | *"You've been here since the Searing? That's over two years! Are there others?"* |
| Erol  | *"Yes. The remnants of my unit, the Flaming Scepter Mages."* |
| Rurik | *"Soldiers who have been slaves since the end of the war?"*  |
| Erol  | *"They're being held in the ruins of the old capital, Drascir."* |
| Rurik | *"Then we go to Drascir."*                                   |
| Erol  | *"My Lord, night is falling. If we don't head for the Wall now, we may all be captured."* |
| Rurik | *"I understand the dangers, but Balthazar be damned if I allow those soldiers to remain slaves to the Charr."* |
| Erol  | *"I can show you where they are being held."*                |
| Rurik | *"Very good. We head north then. To Drascir."*               |

The party will then head north and eventually come to a raised drawbridge for some old ruins, separated by a river of tar. Rurik will task the party with finding a way to lower the bridge while he and Erol wait. The lever can be found on the opposite side of the river, near the drawbridge itself. Once the drawbridge is lowered, Rurik and Erol will cross. A group of Charr can be seen down below in the following valley.

*Side Quest: Follow the Flame Keeper*

|      | Prince Rurik                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"This is a fight we cannot win. We must avoid a confrontation with that group at all costs. Come with me. I grew up in this city, and I know a way around them. Our only chance is to run for the obelisks in the ruins of the Royal Academy."* |

Rurik will then proceed to lead the party down into the valley to a small group of charr (not the large one previously spotted) who are guarding three mages. Upon liberating the mages, everyone runs towards the obelisks in the old Royal Academy courtyard and Rurik works on opening the door through chants. In this final stand against the charr, the mages will assist in fighting off waves of enemies - how many and how hard is up to the GM or random rolls of dice. `INSERT RULE?`

Eventually, Rurik finally gets the doors open, revealing a portal inside `INSERT PICTURE`. Rurik will yell for everyone to get inside as a swarms of charr pour into the courtyard. The party slams the door shut just in time, only to hear the efforts of the charr trying to get in from the other side.

|       | Dialogue                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik | *"That was closer than I'd hoped."*<br /><br />Gestures to the portal.<br /><br />*"This portal will take us to the Academy at Nolani. From there we can make it to the Wall and cross over to Rin. We should hurry though - the magical wards will hold back the Charr, but not for long."* |
| Erol  | *"Wait, my lord. Come, look at what I have found."*<br /><br />Gesturing towards an old horn relic. Rurik hurries over to look. |
| Rurik | *"Is that...?"*                                              |
| Erol  | *"Yes, my prince. I believe it is the mouthpiece for the fabled horn, Stormcaller! With this weapon we could destroy the Charr once and for all. Ascalon could be saved."* |
| Rurik | *I have heard the stories of the horn's magic, but let us not be too hasty. If this is what you say it is, then we must get it to Rin. We'll see for ourselves how much power this Stormcaller has.*<br /><br />*"Come. We'll take this to my father, King Adelbern. Surely he will know if discovering this weapon is our salvation... or simply too late. Either way, staying here will surely be the death of us. Quickly, through the portal!"* |

The portal send the party to the Nolani Academy courtyard in Southwestern Ascalon.

#### 1.5 - Nolani Academy

Within Nolani Academy, the party will find Flaming Scepter Mage Danan on guard. Talking with him will initiate the following conversation:

|      | Flaming Scepter Mage Danan                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"Have you heard the news? We're saved! The artifact horn Stormcaller has been found! Were we inside the walls of Rin, there would be great rejoicing."*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"The mouthpiece of the legendary horn of King Doric. Surely you've seen the pipes of the horn itself up on Horn Hill, outside of Rin! The horn is a powerful weapon. They say that the sounds of the billowing pipes will render helpless the enemies of Ascalon. The mouthpiece was lost during the last Guild War, but now that it has been found it could help us defend the Capital against the Charr. The horn was placed outside of Rin long before the Great Northern Wall was even built. It was the last line of defense against invaders. I'm afraid it has come to that again. If only we'd found Stormcaller before the Searing."*<br /><br />[GR] What are we waiting for? Let's be off to Rin.<br /><br />*"I couldn't agree with you more. But alas, though the gates of the academy are closed, a small army of Charr is mustered outside ready to sweep in and destroy us all. Prince Rurik and my brothers, the Flaming Scepter Mages, have managed to activate the old defenses of this place. They hold the Charr at bay with the charged magical obelisks near the gate. Still, things look bleak. Eventually there will be enough of those beasts to simply overrun us, then Stormcaller will once again be lost to us."*<br /><br />[GR] What must we do?<br /><br />*"Prince Rurik knows a secret passage out of this academy. If you can sneak out and ambush the Charr, perhaps we'll make it out of this alive and return to Rin as heroes."*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"May Balthazar light your path. Go with speed."* |

Prior to leaving on the mission, the party may decide to accept help from a Flame Scepter Mage to accompany them. When ready, Prince Rurik will show the party a secret passage to get out of the Academy without using the front gate. While the front gate may still be opened, the risk is high and may result in unexpected consequences to the players. Once outside the academy, the party will be able to ambush a Charr squadron from behind.

Following the elimination of the immediate threat, Rurik will open the gate and accompany the party on their way to the wall between them and Rin. Along the way, the group may choose to do more than clear the immediate path, and in turn help Ascalonian Rangers in exchange for their aide. Eventually, the party will reach the wall and dialogue will ensue:

|       | Dialogue                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Guard | *"Prince Rurik! What are you doing out here"*                |
| Rurik | *"Open this door! You will let us through!"*                 |
| Guard | *"But sir, the king swore death if the door was opened."*    |
| Rurik | *"And I swear death if you don't stand aside this instant."* |
| Guard | *"Yes, my prince."*                                          |
| Rurik | *"I defend Ascalon against another Charr invasion and my father trifles with doors."* |
| Guard | *"You'll speak to the king, won't you? You'll tell him I had no choice?"* |
| Rurik | As Rurik walks through the gateway, the burning city of Rin is revealed in the distance.<br /><br />*"By Balthazar's beard! Rin burns! I told the king the Charr would not be held for long. We must go to Horn Hill! Only Stormcaller can save the city now."* |

Immediately following the dialogue, Rurik will rush towards Rin to attempt defending the city from invaders. The prince must live, so the players need to defend him. As they head to Horn Hill, they may attempt to save other prisoners taken by the charr, who in turn will help the group. Once at Horn Hill, Rurik places the mouthpiece in place and blows.

The sound of the horn shakes the entire surrounding area, and causes the downpour of rain to begin. This in turn puts out the fires, thus weakening the Charr. All that's left is clearing out the below courtyard, inhabited by the Charr chieftain Bonfaaz Burntfur and his small army. Once the fight is over, a final dialogue sequence will take place:

|          | Dialogue                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik    | The sound of trumpets begins nearby.<br /><br />*"Trumpets! The king must be near. The fall of Rin will have darkened his heart. Hail King Adelbern!"* |
| Adelbern | Six royal guards proceed Adelbern, who eventually walks down the steps towards the remaining party, and everyone bows.<br /><br />*"Rise my son. You have done well. The discovery of Stormcaller is surely a sign of victory."* |
| Rurik    | *"It is a powerful weapon, but I fear not enough. The Charr have amassed an army of many thousands."* |
| Adelbern | *"You overestimate these beasts, Rurik. Do not be afraid."*  |
| Rurik    | *"I am not afraid father. I have seen them in battle. Rin has been destroyed! It would be wise to escape while we can. We should make for Kryta and rebuild our strength. Not wait here for death."* |
| Adelbern | *"I will never allow Ascalonians to live in the shadow of the Krytans! It is Rin that will be rebuilt. And you will learn your place."* |
| Rurik    | *"You have grown proud, Adelbern of Ascalon... proud and foolish."* |
| Adelbern | *"You would dare call your king a fool? I will hear no more. I banish you from Ascalon! You are no longer my prince, and you are no longer my son!"* |
| Rurik    | *"People of Rin! Your king will lead you to death. If you wish to see better days, if you wish to live, then leave the beasts behind and follow me over the Shiverpeaks. We make for Kryta and a new life, free of the Charr."* |

**Summary:** Pitney is sad about the death of a good friend (Old Mac), and asks the party to retrieve his party so he can give a proper burial. What Pitney doesn't know, is that Old Mac and his pet Devourer, Joe, are both alive and kicking. And Mac would much appreciate an escort back to Piken Square.

- While exactly where Old Mac and Joe are found doesn't matter much, it is recommended the party has a chance fighting against at least one Charr patrol to provide a bit of challenge.
- While escorting Old Mac is the real mission here, returning a dead Mac (likely through failure of adequate protection) is an option. Either way, Pitney will thank the group - but the GM may want to reward he final words.

**Summary:** Ambassador Zain wants to help, hoping that his tidings of charity will open up friendly relations between Kryta and Rin. To help, he's provided some necessary supplies for the children that were orphaned during the Searing. All he asks of the party is that they deliver the supplies to Ellie Rigby in Ascalon City. Unfortunately, when King Adelbern hears about this he will be furious because he doesn't trust any Krytans.

King Adelbern however will not allow me in the city to deliver these supplies."<br/><br />"Would you help the children of Ascalon for me and deliver the supplies?"* |

Upon exiting Ascalon City, the party may witness some dialogue between King Adelbern and Prince Rurik:

| Rurik    | *"Ambassador Zain is here to offer us aid. He extends his hand in friendship."* |
| Adelbern | *"No Krytan will ever be a friend of Ascalon."*              |
| Rurik    | *"Do not be foolish, old man! If you have not noticed, Ascalon is in no position to turn away help, even from those who were once our enemies."* |
| Adelbern | *"I grow tired of this, Rurik. Step aside this instant! We are here to arrest Ambassador Zain and try him as a traitor of this nation."* |
| Rurik    | *"I will not allow you to jeopardize the fate of Ascalon because of your petty jealous! If you intent to arrest the ambassador, then you will have to go through me."*<br /><br />*"Go home father. Let me deal with this."* |
| Adelbern | *"This is a mistake, Rurik. Mark my words. This Krytan will be the death of us all. Guards. With me."* |

The party will meet a scavenger who goes by the name Thaddiel. He is very evasive in any of his answers and is overall not very cooperative. However, he can be convinced to leave as a solution.

The ghost of Althea can be found standing in the Diessa Lowlands (where at is up to the GM), surrounded by various Charr. Talking with her will give the party the explanation of what happened.

| Main | *"Some new trouble regarding Ambassador Zain has come to my attention. He has been giving strange artifacts to our merchants in lieu of gold. These Eldritch Sextants must be viewed with some suspicion, and we cannot discount the possibility of a Krytan plot.<br/><br />For now, the king has prohibited any further trading of these objects, but I would like you to take one of them to Priestess Rashenna. Perhaps her wisdom can uncover what sort of threat they pose."* |
| Post | *"I am glad to see you finally managed to deliver the sextant. I had some doubts about your understanding of the seriousness of the matter, but it seems they were ungrounded. I am certain that Priestess Rashenna will discern the true nature of these devices.<br/><br />King Adelbern has too much respect for the old laws to harm Ambassador Zain without cause, but should the artifacts prove less than innocuous, we will surely make the Krytans regret this attempted treachery."* |

| Inter | *"Ah, so this is the Eldritch Sextant that has caused so much concern. Fascinating. It will take some time for me to study this device, but I assure you that I will send word to Tydus as soon as I have discerned the artifact's secrets."* |

| Main | *"There are no more stalwart people than the people of Ascalon. They see the good work that Prince Rurik and his Vanguard are doing, and each day their will to take the fight to the Charr grows. I have more volunteers to join the Vanguard than I can equip."<br/><br />"I've ordered equipment and supplies for several new recruits from a merchant named Gelsan in Regent Valley, and I'd be greatly appreciative if you could go pick up the equipment and return it here to me. If you're willing to help, just travel south out of Fort Ranik into Regent Valley. He'll be along the road somewhere."* |
| Post | *"Is that chest what I hope it is? Ah, yes, good... Looks like the supplies we ordered are all here. Thank you for attending to this matter. I do not doubt Gelsan made it far more difficult than it needed to be. He is a greedy cur, that one, but he usually comes through in the end, and now is not the time to turn our backs on anyone who might help our cause."* |

| Inter I  | *"So good ole Captain Arne wants that gear, eh? Well, I'm all for that, but some bandits ran off with it. If you can find those fellows and bring me back the stolen goods, I'll be more than happy to give you what you came for. Just be sure to bring 'em back to me directly. Not everything in there is what was paid for by your Captain Arne."* |
| Inter II | [If the party retrieves the stolen goods]<br /><br />*"Well then, that seems to be everything. Funny, isn't it? Nothing like any military gear in here, but you're in luck: Turns out that it was just mislaid out back. So here you go, no harm done to anyone what didn't deserve it, eh?"* |
