## Ascalon

*Blasted and battered, the current landscape of Ascalon holds only the ghost of its former glory. Skeletons of grand cathedrals and remnants of whole cities lie broken on the shifted, displaced ground. The protective Great Northern Wall is perhaps the most intact structure in the entire kingdom, but the destruction that surrounds it lies in testament to its ultimate failure.* 

*Before the Charr invasion and the Searing, Ascalon was a fertile land, full of wheat fields and blossoming flowers. Now though, little grows here in this wasteland. The once loamy earth is now dry and arid. The riverbeds have dried up, and the mudflats have turned into a patchwork of cracked plates and jagged scars in the ground.*

\- The Guildwars Manuscripts

Ascalon is the remains of a once powerful kingdom, now in ruins standing testament to the power of the Searing. The Great Northern Wall stands, breached and broken in several areas, dividing the land between the north and south. Current day Ascalon is no longer green, instead filled with scorched and barren earth, hostile inhabitants, and deadly geographical features. Breaking up the monotony of ruin are some remaining sites, consisting of small communities attempting to survive, unique land transformations, or old ruins from the past.

**The Great Northern Wall.** The Great Wall began construction near the start of the last Guild Wars to protect Ascalon against threats by the Charr, stretching from the Shiverpeak Mountains to the Eastern Frontier. Over time, Ascalonians expanded northward beyond the wall and established great cities beyond the wall's protection. The Wall was severely damaged and broken during the Searing and now stands as a mere shadow of its former glory. There are two main passages between the north and south currently accessible: Hammer Gate to the west of Ascalon City, and Frontier Gate in the north of the Eastern Frontier.

### South of the Wall

**Ascalon City.** Residing upon the southern side of The Wall, Ascalon City is the largest city and cultural center of Ascalon, although her structures lie in shambles. One of the few remaining locations is the area - a large circle with a tar pond in the middle. The residents of the city are comprised of traders, refugees from the surrounding lands, and soldiers. 

- <u>Captain Arne</u> can be found recruiting able bodied adventurers to the cause of Prince Rurick's Vanguard. Those who decide to aid the cause can expect to help protect supply runs, help local soldier outposts, and carry out missions eradicating nearby Charr encampments.
- <u>Symon the Scribe</u> is trying to archive the history of Ascalon before it all goes to ruin. Travelers could bring him historical information to record for a small reward, or ask about locations nearby to explore in return for bringing back something important.

- <u>Warmaster Tydus</u> is an Ascalonian military officer loyal to King Adelbern. Tydus always has tasks needing completed, ranging from the delivery of messages, escorting recruits, defending the wall, and clearing out scavengers.

**Eastern Frontier.** Once a land of rolling green hills, the Eastern Frontier is now like the rest of Ascalon – ruined, barren, and littered with ruins. Large sections of the once great wall now lie scattered and broken. To the north lies Frontier Gate, a pre-searing portal of entry, with the ruins of Surmia beyond.

- Caravans of traders and refugees often face dangers of attacks in this area. Adventurers in need of coin can find a job escorting every so often.
- The Charr have established a foothold along the northern parts of the frontier. Unlucky parties may find themselves walking into an encampment unprepared.
- The hostile land has allowed the grawl and devourers to flourish - groups should take care to be appropriately prepared.

**Old Ascalon.** The plains were once covered in hills and farms and populated with citizens wanting to live outside of Ascalon city. Now, like the remainder of Ascalon, the land is now barren and blasted. In the center of Old Ascalon lies Sardelac Sanitarium - a small settlement once known as Ashford Abbey and home to the Ascalon Catacombs. During the Searing, entrance to the Catacombs collapsed.

In the north of Old Ascalon is the location the Charr broke through the wall and invaded the rest of Ascalon known as "the Breach." Heading south leads to the Regent Valley. Adventurers here are likely to find residents in need of some form of help, as most who reside here have lost almost everything to the Searing.

**Pockmark Flats.** At the southern end of the Eastern Frontier lies the Pockmark Flats. In the north lies the Pockmark Crystal - an exceedingly large crystal leftover from the Searing, embedded in the earth, and surrounded by a moat of tar. The south holds testament to the destruction during the Searing, demonstrating an extensive stretch of ruins and broken architecture with uneven trials winding through the landscape. 

One such ruin is the remains of Serenity Temple, known to once be the largest in Ascalon, and dedicated to all five Tyrian gods. The priests and priestesses of the temple try their best to continue their worship and rituals, though the temple is now nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding rubble.

**Regent Valley.** The land stripped bare and the rivers befouled, Regent Valley is now overrun by monsters, highwaymen, and Charr. Fort Ranik, ruins of an old Ascalon military facility from the Guild Wars, can be found in the north eastern part of the valley.

- <u>Lord Darrin</u> was tasked with overseeing Fort Ranik before the searing, and continues to remain dutifully at his post. He can always use help to aid his cause or to make the surrounding land safer.
-  Many creatures call this area home now, with the most predominant inhabitants being devourers, grawl, moa, and bandits. The Charr have also claimed portions of land and make travel that much more difficult.

### North of the Wall

**Ascalon Foothills.** Perhaps one of the most dangerous areas within the region, the Ascalon Foothills is the natural transition between the plains and the Shiverpeak mountains. The ill-prepared may find themselves face to face with elementals and hydra here.

**Diessa Lowlands.** The Diessa Lowlands is covered with the jagged ruins of past cities in remembrance of the invasion. One such ruin is the former grand courthouse of Grendich Village, now standing in shambles. Travels through here are dangerous due to the roaming Charr, elementals, and gargoyles.

**Dragon's Gullet.** In the northern most parts of Ascalon lies a wasteland of tar pits, rugged hills, and scattered ruins known as the Dragon’s Gullet. This extremely inhospitable area is home to little wildlife, but those that remain have managed to adapt to the hostile environment. To the south is a strip of land known as the Flame Temple Corridor, a small blasted area of gullies winding between the surrounding hills. The Charr have made a makeshift flame temple here where they perform ritual sacrifices.

**Drascir.** (?)

**Nolani Academy.** [TBA]

**Piken Square.** A small settlement just north of the wall, Piken Square was a bustling market where farmers and merchants would come to hawk their wares. Now only ruined stalls remain, abandoned and empty like the graveyard contained within.

**Surmia.** [TBA]
