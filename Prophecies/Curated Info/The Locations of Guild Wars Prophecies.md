## Ascalon

This area is split into three overarching areas: The Northlands, The Eastern Frontier, and The Plains of Ashford.

### The Northlands

*Containing Game Areas of: Diessa Lowlands, Dragon’s Gullet, Flame Temple Corridor, The Breach, the Great Northern Wall, and Piken Square.*

#### Diessa Lowlands

The Diessa Lowlands, like the rest of Ascalon, is scorched, barren, and dotted with the ruins of Ascalonian cities. One such ruin is the former grand courthouse of Gredich Village. 

What you can find here: Charr patrols, gargoyles, elementals, devourers..

#### Dragon’s Gullet

In the northern parts of the Diessa Plateau is a wasteland of tar pits, rugged hills, and scattered ruins known as the Dragon’s Gullet. This extremely inhospitable area is home to little wildlife, but those that remain have managed to adapt to the hostile environment. 

What you can find here: Charr Patrols (rare), …

#### Flame Temple Corridor

Separating Dragon’s Gullet from the rest of the Diessa Plateau is a strip of land known as the Flame Temple Corridor, a small blasted area of gullies winding between the surrounding hills. The Charr have made a makeshift flame temple here where they perform ritual sacrifices.

What you can find here:

#### The Breach

Named “the Breach” post scorching, this is the area where the Charr first broke through and invaded the Rest of Ascalon. In addition to the scorched land, the rivers are tainted with tar from the Charr invasion.

What you can find here: 

#### Great Northern Wall



#### Hammer Gate

### The Eastern Frontier

*Containing Game Areas of: The Eastern Frontiers, Pockmark Flats, and Ruins of Surmia*

Once a land of lush green rolling hills, the Eastern Frontier is now like the rest of Ascalon – ruined, barren, and littered with ruins. Large sections of the once great wall now lie scattered and broken. The remains of Surmia, built as a monument to those who died in the second Guild Wars and a prosperous city of Ascalon, lie just to the north of the Northern Wall barrier.

What you can find here: Charr Encampments (NE), Grawl (NW), Devourers (S)
