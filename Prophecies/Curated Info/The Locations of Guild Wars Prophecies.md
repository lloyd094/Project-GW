# The Locations of "Guild Wars: Prophecies"

This document covers the locations of the Guild Wars Prophecies Campaign, organized into TTRPG sectors and converted from the MMO sections.

> I am currently trying to figure out where all these areas should be arranged into. If you have suggestions or ideas, please feel free to move/mark areas where they should be moved and make a note of it!
>
> Of course, <u>everything here is currently subject to change/removal/etc</u>. This is still the planning stage of things.

## Ascalon

This area is split into three overarching areas: The Northlands, The Eastern Frontier, and The Plains of Ashford.

### The Northlands

*Containing Game Areas of: Diessa Lowlands, Dragon’s Gullet, Flame Temple Corridor, The Breach, the Great Northern Wall, and Piken Square.*

#### Diessa Lowlands

The Diessa Lowlands, like the rest of Ascalon, is scorched, barren, and dotted with the ruins of Ascalonian cities. One such ruin is the former grand courthouse of Gredich Village. 

<u>What you can find here</u>: Charr patrols, gargoyles, elementals, devourers..

#### Dragon’s Gullet

In the northern parts of the Diessa Plateau is a wasteland of tar pits, rugged hills, and scattered ruins known as the Dragon’s Gullet. This extremely inhospitable area is home to little wildlife, but those that remain have managed to adapt to the hostile environment. 

<u>What you can find here</u>: Charr Patrols (rare), …

#### Flame Temple Corridor

Separating Dragon’s Gullet from the rest of the Diessa Plateau is a strip of land known as the Flame Temple Corridor, a small blasted area of gullies winding between the surrounding hills. The Charr have made a makeshift flame temple here where they perform ritual sacrifices.

<u>What you can find here</u>:

#### The Breach

Named “the Breach” post scorching, this is the area where the Charr first broke through and invaded the Rest of Ascalon. In addition to the scorched land, the rivers are tainted with tar from the Charr invasion.

<u>What you can find here</u>: 

#### Great Northern Wall

The Great Wall began construction near the start of the last Guild Wars to protect Ascalon against threats by the Charr, stretching from the Shiverpeak Mountains to the Eastern Frontier. Over time, Ascalonians expanded northward beyond the wall and established great cities beyond the wall's protection. The Wall was severely damaged and broken during The Searing, now standing as a mere shadow of its former glory. 

##### Hammer Gate

One of the few gates connecting Old Ascalon to the Northlands, Hammer Gate is is now used as the primary gate of passage to the north.

##### The Northern Gate

Prior to the Searing, the Northern Gate was the grand, diplomatic entrance used to greet visiting dignitaries. Now, it is just another outpost, manned by the Ascalon army and citizens who volunteer for guard duty.

#### Piken Square

In years past, Piken Square was a bustling market where farmers and merchants would come to hawk their wares. Now only ruined stalls remain, abandoned and empty like the graveyard contained within.

### The Eastern Frontier

*Containing Game Areas of: The Eastern Frontiers, Pockmark Flats, and Ruins of Surmia*

Once a land of lush green rolling hills, the Eastern Frontier is now like the rest of Ascalon – ruined, barren, and littered with ruins. Large sections of the once great wall now lie scattered and broken. The remains of Surmia, built as a monument to those who died in the second Guild Wars and a prosperous city of Ascalon, lie just to the north of the Northern Wall barrier. 

<u>What you can find here</u>: Charr Encampments (NE), Grawl (NW), Devourers (S)

#### Pockmark Flats

At the southern end of the Eastern Frontier lies the Pockmark Flats. In the north lies the Pockmark Crystal - an exceedingly large crystal leftover from the Searing, embedded in the earth, and surrounded by a moat of tar. The south holds testament to the destruction during the Searing, demonstrating an extensive stretch of ruins and broken architecture with uneven trials winding through the landscape. 

One such ruin was the Serenity Temple, known to once be the largest in Ascalon, dedicated to all five Tyrian gods. The priests and priestesses of the temple try their best to continue their worship and rituals, though the temple is now nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding rubble.
