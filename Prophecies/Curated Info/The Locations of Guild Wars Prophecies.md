## Ascalon

*Blasted and battered, the current landscape of Ascalon holds only the ghost of its former glory. Skeletons of grand cathedrals and remnants of whole cities lie broken on the shifted, displaced ground. The protective Great Northern Wall is perhaps the most intact structure in the entire kingdom, but the destruction that surrounds it lies in testament to its ultimate failure.* 

*Before the Charr invasion and the Searing, Ascalon was a fertile land, full of wheat fields and blossoming flowers. Now though, little grows here in this wasteland. The once loamy earth is now dry and arid. The riverbeds have dried up, and the mudflats have turned into a patchwork of cracked plates and jagged scars in the ground.*

\- The Guildwars Manuscripts

Ascalon is the remains of a once powerful kingdom, now in ruins standing testament to the power of the Searing. The Great Northern Wall stands, breached and broken in several areas, dividing the land between the north and south. Current day Ascalon is no longer green, instead filled with scorched and barren earth, hostile inhabitants, and deadly geographical features. Breaking up the monotony of ruin are some remaining sites, consisting of small communities attempting to survive, unique land transformations, or old ruins from the past.

**The Great Northern Wall.** The Great Wall began construction near the start of the last Guild Wars to protect Ascalon against threats by the Charr, stretching from the Shiverpeak Mountains to the Eastern Frontier. Over time, Ascalonians expanded northward beyond the wall and established great cities beyond the wall's protection. The Wall was severely damaged and broken during the Searing and now stands as a mere shadow of its former glory. There are two main passages between the north and south currently accessible: Hammer Gate to the west of Ascalon City, and Frontier Gate in the north of the Eastern Frontier.

### South of the Wall

**Ascalon City.** Residing upon the southern side of The Wall, Ascalon City is the largest city and cultural center of Ascalon, although her structures lie in shambles. One of the few remaining locations is the area - a large circle with a tar pond in the middle. The residents of the city are comprised of traders, refugees from the surrounding lands, and soldiers. 

- <u>Captain Arne</u> can be found recruiting able bodied adventurers to the cause of Prince Rurick's Vanguard. Those who decide to aid the cause can expect to help protect supply runs, help local soldier outposts, and carry out missions eradicating nearby Charr encampments.
- <u>Symon the Scribe</u> is trying to archive the history of Ascalon before it all goes to ruin. Travelers could bring him historical information to record for a small reward, or ask about locations nearby to explore in return for bringing back something important.

- <u>Warmaster Tydus</u> is an Ascalonian military officer loyal to King Adelbern. Tydus always has tasks needing completed, ranging from the delivery of messages, escorting recruits, defending the wall, and clearing out scavengers.

**Eastern Frontier.** Once a land of rolling green hills, the Eastern Frontier is now like the rest of Ascalon – ruined, barren, and littered with ruins. Large sections of the once great wall now lie scattered and broken. To the north lies Frontier Gate, a pre-searing portal of entry, with the ruins of Surmia beyond.

- Caravans of traders and refugees often face dangers of attacks in this area. Adventurers in need of coin can find a job escorting every so often.
- The Charr have established a foothold along the northern parts of the frontier. Unlucky parties may find themselves walking into an encampment unprepared.
- The hostile land has allowed the grawl and devourers to flourish - groups should take care to be appropriately prepared.

**Old Ascalon.** The plains were once covered in hills and farms and populated with citizens wanting to live outside of Ascalon city. Now, like the remainder of Ascalon, the land is now barren and blasted. In the center of Old Ascalon lies Sardelac Sanitarium - a small settlement once known as Ashford Abbey and home to the Ascalon Catacombs. During the Searing, entrance to the Catacombs collapsed.

In the north of Old Ascalon is the location the Charr broke through the wall and invaded the rest of Ascalon known as "the Breach." Heading south leads to the Regent Valley. Adventurers here are likely to find residents in need of some form of help, as most who reside here have lost almost everything to the Searing.

**Pockmark Flats.** At the southern end of the Eastern Frontier lies the Pockmark Flats. In the north lies the Pockmark Crystal - an exceedingly large crystal leftover from the Searing, embedded in the earth, and surrounded by a moat of tar. The south holds testament to the destruction during the Searing, demonstrating an extensive stretch of ruins and broken architecture with uneven trials winding through the landscape. 

One such ruin is the remains of Serenity Temple, known to once be the largest in Ascalon, and dedicated to all five Tyrian gods. The priests and priestesses of the temple try their best to continue their worship and rituals, though the temple is now nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding rubble.

**Regent Valley.** The land stripped bare and the rivers befouled, Regent Valley is now overrun by monsters, highwaymen, and Charr. Fort Ranik, ruins of an old Ascalon military facility from the Guild Wars, can be found in the north eastern part of the valley.

- <u>Lord Darrin</u> was tasked with overseeing Fort Ranik before the searing, and continues to remain dutifully at his post. He can always use help to aid his cause or to make the surrounding land safer.
-  Many creatures call this area home now, with the most predominant inhabitants being devourers, grawl, moa, and bandits. The Charr have also claimed portions of land and make travel that much more difficult.

### North of the Wall

**Ascalon Foothills.** Perhaps one of the most dangerous areas within the region, the Ascalon Foothills is the natural transition between the plains and the Shiverpeak mountains. The ill-prepared may find themselves face to face with elementals and hydra here.

**Diessa Lowlands.** The Diessa Lowlands is covered with the jagged ruins of past cities in remembrance of the invasion. One such ruin is the former grand courthouse of Grendich Village, now standing in shambles. Travels through here are dangerous due to the roaming Charr, elementals, and gargoyles.

**Dragon's Gullet.** In the northern most parts of Ascalon lies a wasteland of tar pits, rugged hills, and scattered ruins known as the Dragon’s Gullet. This extremely inhospitable area is home to little wildlife, but those that remain have managed to adapt to the hostile environment. To the south is a strip of land known as the Flame Temple Corridor, a small blasted area of gullies winding between the surrounding hills. The Charr have made a makeshift flame temple here where they perform ritual sacrifices.

**Drascir.** (?)

**Nolani Academy.** [TBA]

**Piken Square.** A small settlement just north of the wall, Piken Square was a bustling market where farmers and merchants would come to hawk their wares. Now only ruined stalls remain, abandoned and empty like the graveyard contained within.

**Surmia.** [TBA]

## Crystal Desert

*Legends tell of a time, thousands of years ago, when the Crystal Desert was covered in water. These legends claim that it was the gods who raised the land, leaving it bare and empty in order to give the solitary creatures of the world a place to call their own. If the legends are true, humans were not among those for whom this land was made. There have been attempts by humans to settle in the desert, but they have, without exception, failed miserably, leaving behind only the grand monuments they built here proclaiming their short-lived triumph over this harsh land.*

*The weather in the Crystal Desert is hot and unforgiving. The winds blow hard, making and unmaking dunes, covering up the present and uncovering the past. An examination of the sand will reveal that each grain is actually a tiny, pointed crystal. In isolated locations, larger crystal formations have been revealed by the constant, unforgiving wind.*

\- The Guild Wars Manuscripts

Created shortly before the Exodus of the Gods, the Crystal Desert was once part of the Crystal Sea. The desert connects the northern continent of Tryia to the southern continent of Elona. The desert had once been ruled by the Primeval Kings, and throughout time at least four groups of humans have attempted to settle in the land: Margonites, Elonians, Seekers, and Ascalonians.

The Crystal Desert is mostly arid and dry, though some oases and deep valleys are able to sustain vegetation. Throughout the sands, adventurers are likely to come across giant statues left behind by an ancient civilization, ruins from more recent colonization attempts, and cliffs that can all too easily hide in the waves of heat as if waiting for a dreary traveler to nourish the sands below. In the center of the Crystal Desert lies the Mesa, inhabited by a variety of creatures and ghosts of those who have died in the region.

**The Amnoon Oasis.** This tiny harbor is a travelers last chance for rest, restocking supplies, or enjoying the simple resource of water before adventuring out. Most of those who reside here hold some tie to the merchants, who try their best to make a profit before the adventurer's coin gets lost in the desert sands.

- <u>Fangfa Tai</u> has recently arrived from Elona, and wishes to learn the secrets of his people. He specifically wishes to speak with <u>Sennat Sen</u>, a ghost residing in the Salt Flats. Fangfa claims he has not been able to meet with him, but perhaps a traveler would be able to gather the information he desires?
- A <u>Ghostly Hero</u> can be sometimes be found in the outskirts of the Oasis. Speaking with him will reveal that this is the ghost of <u>Turai Ossa</u>, who had once sought out Ascension before the desert claimed his life. If an adventurer seems capable and interested, the ghost will recommend they visit Augury Rock and speak with <u>Priest Zahmut</u> to learn more about Ascension.

**The Arid Sea.** Perhaps the most inhospitable part of the Crystal Desert, very few creatures are able to survive in the Arid Sea. Once long ago, the Arid Sea was home to a thriving settlement - only dust, ruins, and memories remain now. In the far south, perceptive adventurers may be able to find a discrete passage leading south to Elona.

- The few creatures able to survive here are deadly. Adventurers may find themselves encountering Dune Burrowers, Enchanted Armors, Sand Giants, Hydras, Scarabs, and Sand Wurms. 

**Augury Rock.** [See The Mesa?]

**Diviner's Ascent.** [See Salt Flats (is there an actual difference?)]

**Hero's Audience.** *The ruined statues in this isolated outpost are thought to be remnants of one of the many failed civilizations the Crystal Desert has claimed. When traders first crossed the desert and established themselves amidst these fallen gods, they told one another campfire stories of how these stone figures once lived and granted favors and magics to heroes lost in these harsh lands. Hence the name, Heroes' Audience.*

**Lonely Vigil.** 

**Prophet's Path.** *Prophet's Path is the area of the Desert that is closest to the sea. A line of monoliths mark the namegiving path, leading from The Amnoon Oasis to Augury Rock.*

**Salt Flats.** The north of the Crystal Desert is known as the Salt Flats, an ocean of sand littered with the ruins of an ancient seafaring civilization and massive ancient beasts. As it runs eastward, the Salt Flats become an area better known as Diviner's Ascent.

- A small outpost known as Seeker's Passage sits on the western edge of the Salt Flats. The outpost was named for the Seekers, pilgrims rumored to have crossed the desert in search of a new home. <u>Tirzah</u>, a ghost who died in the Crystal Desert as a pilgrim, can be found nearby. Before her death, she had made a promise to meet her betrothed.
- The Salt Flats are plagued by Devourers, Hydra, Storm Kin, and Scarabs. Drakes and Wurms can also be found in Diviner's Ascent.
- *Elona Reach*

**The Scar.** *The Scar derives its name from the "scar" of greenery that runs through its center, fed by hidden wellsprings. The Losaru centaurs claim this fertile oasis as their own. Surrounding the gorges are rocky cliffs bearing sand dunes upon them, populated by the usual denizens of the desert.*

- *Thirsty River*

**Skyward Reach.** *Skyward Reach is the center of the Crystal Desert. It is itself centered on the Mesa.*

- Augury Rock can be found to the west of the Mesa. <u>Priest Zahamut</u> can be found nearby, waiting to direct worthy heroes to the path of Ascension.

**The Dragon's Lair.** 

**Tomb of the Primeval Kings.** 

**Vulture Drifts.** *Vulture Drifts is dotted with ruins of a failed civilization, overcome by the unforgiving nature of the Crystal Desert. In the northwest, a circular series of strange monuments, perhaps tombs, surrounding a large skeleton of an unknown creature.*

- *Dunes of Despair*

## Kryta

*There are two types of humans in Kryta: those who worship the mysterious Unseen Ones and those who do not. The worshippers have become known as the White Mantle because of the long white sleeveless robes many of them wear.*

*It is the responsibility of the White Mantle to oversee the other humans and impose upon them the rules and laws of the Unseen Ones. Those inside the organization receive special privileges (more food, better clothing, access to books) simply for abiding by the rules of the Unseen Ones and carrying out the orders handed down by the White Mantle high priest. To the Krytans the White Mantle are the root of law and order, the protectors or saviors, if you will, of their lands.*

*The White Mantle maintain a series of temples all over the continent. Members of this organization frequently, though not always, choose to reside in these temples to better perform their duties to the Mantle and to more effectively worship the Unseen Ones.*

*Since the end of the last Guild War and the repelling of the Charr invasion, the White Mantle have maintained a high level of military preparedness. They don’t ever want to be caught off guard again, and they often keep large stores of weapons inside their temples to use in case of emergency. It’s also not uncommon for followers of the Mantle philosophy to be highly trained warriors. Fighting skills will come in handy if the day comes when they will need to once again defend Kryta from invasion.*

*Travelers to Kryta will find a stark contrast between the fortified, polished-stone buildings of the White Mantle and the thatch-roofed huts of the regular citizens. There is a surprising amount of wealth here, but it is kept in the hands of those who adhere to the doctrines of the Mantle, and this is reflected in the architecture of the region.*

*On the coast, the weather is hot and humid. This is somewhat mitigated by the beautiful white-sand beaches and the crystal-clear blue saltwater beyond. Farther inland, it cools down a bit, making the area ideal for farming and raising livestock. Those Krytans who don't practice any of the mystical arts tend to gravitate towards fishing and farming.*

\- The Guild Wars Manuscripts

**The Black Curtain.** This large section of marshland is located in the middle of central Kryta. While few may try living here, most of the land is considered inhospitable due to the roaming undead and other creatures that threaten safety. The eastern transition of land between the Black Curtain and Nebo Terrace is known as the Cursed Lands. In the north lies the Temple of the Ages - ruins that rumored to be a gateway into the realm of the gods.

**D'Alessio Seaboard.** Renamed from the Eastbury Reserve, the D'Alessio Seaboard was named after the founder of the White Mantle founder, Saul D'Alessio. In the west, the White Mantle's Temple of Tolerance stands tall over the landscape and in the south east lies the small village of Hakewood.

**Divinity Coast.** In the northern regions of Kryta are two coasts resting along Giant's Basin - Divinity Coast is the westernmost coast. Several of the region's oldest settlements can be found here, as humans have occupied these lands for over seven hundred years. The waters of the Giant's Basin have been fished for generations by inhabitants.

- <u>Mantle Knight Franklin</u> resides here. If on the Summer Solstice someone claims to be on official White Mantle business, he will direct them to meet <u>Justiciar Hablion</u> in Shaemoor to prepare to administer the Test of the Chosen. Once met, <u>Justiciar Hablion</u> will give the party... {\_?\_}

**Kessex Peak.** South of The Black Curtain rises Kessex Peak, one of the highest points of land within the kingdom of Kryta. The Wizard's Tower can be found floating on a mysterious rock off the south-western edge. No one knows who the wizard was or what powers it's walls contain, but there is rumor that the warrior known as Galrath has been trying to gain access to the tower's secrets.

**Majesty's Rest.** Majesty's Rest is the pass between Kryta and the Maguuma Jungle. The land transitions from the arid canyons in the west to marshes in the east. Surrounded by a lake in the east is the Mausoleum, the tomb for Kryta's royalty.

**Nebo Terrace.** Well populated, Nebo Terrace sits in north-central Kryta between The Cursed Lands and North Krytan Province. There are small settlements scattered throughout the area and a central village, Nebo. The southwest part of the province is swampy and filled with undead, while the southeast is home to the Bergen Hot Springs.

- <u>Beldon the Blade</u> and <u>Kira Thorne</u> are both weaponsmiths specializing in wood, and are in need of supplies. Beldon is in need of mergoyle skulls, while Kira needs local imp hearts. Both are willing to trade weapons from their stock in exhange for these parts.
- <u>Elder Sobel</u> of Nebo Village is looking for help with the recent increase of bandit population in Nebo Terrace. Adventurers looking for some coin and a good fight may discover Sobel to be a good source of work.
- [The Hot Springs Murders]

**North Kryta Province.** In the south of this province is located Lions Arch, the main city within Kryta and primary trading port for the continent of Tyria. The royal palace of King Doric resides here, but the White Mantle now run this city, who have since razed and replaced many of the old buildings with barracks and more practical structures. South of Lion's Arch is the quarantine area known as Lion's Gate, used for processing foreign arrivals and home to the lighthouse. In the north of the province is the Ascalon Settlement, comprised of refugees from Ascalon who escaped the Charr Invasion.

- *Asura Gate*

**Riverside Province.** At the southernmost portion of the Krytan kingdom rests the Riverside Province, a marshland area populated with major Krytan settlements. The Ullen River runs from the north through the province into the Maguuma Jungle. In the eastern part of the province is the Temple of the Unseen - a heavily guarded temple responsible for the White Mantle prominence in the area.

**Sanctum Cay.** This beautiful harbor is a favorite location for cargo ships traveling to Kryta from Cantha. In the southeast are the ruins of an old monastery rumored to be the origin of smiting prayers and the transformation of Krtyan Monks from passive healers to aggressive defenders of the land.

**Scoundrel's Rise.** Along the eastern border of Kryta lies a small sandy area littered with shipwrecks known as scoundrel's Rise. Some believe the area was once a submerged part of Giant's Basin.

**Stingray Strand.** Stingray Strand is a beautiful stretch of beach on the western side of Kryta. Unfortunately the heavy presence of hostile Tengu and Skale harms the idyllic nature. Fishermen's Haven can be found on the eastern coast, rumored to be home to the best fishing in all of Krtya. There is a legend that claims that fish were once so plentiful that one only had to skim the surface with a net to bring in the equivalent of a full day's catch from other bodies of water.

**Talmark Wilderness.** The Talkmark Wilderness, a large area of rolling hiss and beautiful wilderness, is located in northwest Krtya. A river flows from the direction of Majesty's Rest to the gulf below. South of the river is Dakutu Village, a small settlement who cultivates the surrounding land and follow the Krytan royal family.

**Tears of the Fallen.** Between Talmark Wilderness and Stingray Strand is a small area with two tear-shaped lakes close to the beach known as Tears of the Fallen. Small farms dot the western sides of the lakes, and the area is known to have problems with Bog Skales.

**Twin Serpent Lakes.** Given it's name because of the two snake head shaped lakes in the north and south, and the winding natural passes between the two, the Twin Serpent Lakes appear as if two serpents intertwined. Others believe the lakes look like footprints, giving the nickname the footprint lakes. The lakes and streams make the surrounding marshes bountiful hunting grounds. While many creatures call this area home, one of the most prominent are the Caromi Tengu.

**Watchtower Coast.** Watchtower Coast is the easternmost coast along Giant's Basin in northern Kryta. It's name is derived from ancient watchtowers that dot the landscape. While their true purpose for their existence is unknown, rumors say they were built to fend off some unknown threat from across Giant's Basin.

- <u>Farmer Fanella</u> can be found to the west of Beetletun, offering fresh produce to anyone with coin. If asked the right questions or in a particular mood, Fanella may disclose recent visits from Peacekeeper Enforcers demanding profits as donation to the White Mantle under threat of report to the Unseen Ones.
- <u>Tenlach Silverhand</u> and <u>Ian Sturmme</u> can both be found venturing throughout the coast looking for supplies. Tenlach specifically is looking for abnormal seeds dropped by wandering plants, while Ian needs scalps from Tengu. Both will offer to trade some helms they created in exchange for the sought after supplies.
- The village of **Beetletun** is in the southeastern corner of Watchtower Coast. Shortly after entering the village, <u>Elder Hezron</u> may request help in warding off an undead horde that was recently spotted headed towards Beetletun from the coast.

## Maguuma Jungle

*Years ago, many tribes of human druids lived among the Maguuma's lush greenery and wildlife. But it has been a long time since anyone has heard word from them, and many believe that they were eaten by hostile jungle creatures or simply swallowed whole by the man-eating plants now rampant in the jungle.*

*The higher elevations are mostly devoid of water. Only the largest and hardiest of plants can live here. But down farther, closer to the water table, the Maguuma grows thick. The vegetation can become so dense that there are areas of the jungle floor that have never been touched by the sun's light.*

## Ring of Fire Islands

*Just south of the Tarnished Coast lie the volcanic islands that together make up the Ring of Fire. The large volcano at the center of the ring is where the gods reportedly dropped the Bloodstones before leaving Tyria for good. Of the islands that surround this one, many are still active. Ships that pass by the Ring report hearing the tell-tale hiss of scalding hot lava hitting the ocean, instantly vaporizing the saltwater into steam.*

*The reefs off the islands are formed of black pumice stone. There are very few natural ports, and those that might be suitable for docking would bring the crew of the ship within danger of being caught by a sudden, unexpected eruption.*

*There are no known settlements in the Ring of Fire.*

## Shiverpeak Mountains

*For hundreds of years, all the dwarves in this mountain range were united under one flag: the nation of the Deldrimor dwarves. Most of the architecture in the Shiverpeaks was built during this time, and it reflects a time of peace and prosperity—but that time is over now. Today, the mountains ring with the sounds of civil war, and new architecture has sprung up: slabs of stone lashed together with huge iron chains mark the areas where a new guild—those who have broken from the old ways—have made new settlements.*

*The Shiverpeaks are an inhospitable environment for the ill-prepared. There are only two known passes through the mountains, and any wishing to cross them must endure freezing wind, flash snow storms, and unstable terrain that shifts with the change in temperature.*
