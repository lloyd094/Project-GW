## The Human Gods

The Human Gods of Tyria are the most commonly worshiped gods within Tyria. These beings are worshipped by humans and other races for their creation of the world and their provisions of knowledge, magic, and other favors. These beings hold multiple titles, including the Old Gods, The Five, Ancient Ones, Tyrian Gods, and True Gods. According to history, these gods left the world of Tyria during the Exodus of the Gods in year 0.

The current pantheon consists of:

- Dwayna: The high Goddess of Healing, Air, Warmth, and Life (Head of the Pantheon)
- Balthazar: The Heroic God of War, Fire, Strength, and Challenge
- Melandru: The Mother Goddess of Nature, Earth, Protection, and Growth
- Lyssa: The Twin Goddesses of Beauty, Water, Energy, and Illusion (Individually, Lyss and Iilya)
- Grenth: The Arbiter God of Darkness, Ice, Death, and Judgmen

### Dwayna

*And when the world rang with the clanging of swords and did fire fall from the skies, Dwayna, goddess of life and air, heard the wailings and pleas of the weak.*

*And when the rumblings of war did not cease, came Her charge, [Doric](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/King_Doric), who did prostrate himself at Her feet.*

*And cast She now a glance upon the war-torn lands and wasted flesh of the fallen, and with tears upon Her cheek did lay Her gentle hands upon the prostrate man. Then saith She unto to him and all Her charges, "Lay down thy weapons, and as I have done unto ye, so ye must do for your brethren. Offer protection to the weak. Give solace and shelter to those who need it. Be ye a salve to the wounded.*

*"For I am your goddess, and I will give blessings to all who follow these teachings."*

*— Scriptures of Dwayna, 115 BE*

Dwayna is the Goddess of Life and Air. She is the patron Goddess of Wind Prayers Dervishes, Air Elementalists, Healing Prayers Monks, and Leadership and Motivation Paragons, and is linked to the Season of the Zephyr in the Elonian calendar.

Dwayna was the first of the Gods to step forth from the Mists, as well as the one who brought humanity to the world. She sought to make the world a paradise and led her people to peace for a time. Her teachings are celebrated during Wintersday, where her followers compete with Grenth to decide which god will dominate the coming year.

Dwayna is usually depicted as young, tall and slender, rising above the ground on feathered wings. Canthans depict her as floating above the souls of their ancestors, whereas Elonians often depict her rising above drought-ravaged lands. Most statues of Dwayna lie in ruins, but when the world gains the Favor of the Gods, a lightning bolt strikes the broken pieces and they rearrange themselves into the form of the Goddess, supported by a ray of holy light.

### Balthazar

*For weeks did the battle rage on, and those who had taken up the mantle of war grew weary and their courage began to falter.*

*Then did Balthazar, god of war and fire, appear to the soldiers, carrying with him a grand sword that did glow with such brilliance it blinded any who looked upon it. When he spoke, His voice was like thunder, and it shook the ground with force.*

*Then saith He, "Lift up thy weapons. For you are my soldiers, and must you be steadfast, strong, and brave of heart. They who neither hesitate nor stumble shall be rewarded. Then shall you have glory. Then shall your deeds be remembered for eternity."*

*And then did release from His sword a hundred thousand flames, which encircled the soldiers. For this was the fire of courage, and forthwith did they follow the god into battle without fear or hesitation. Thence was the enemy struck down.*

*— Scriptures of Balthazar, 48 BE*

Balthazar is the God of War, Fire, and Challenge. He is the patron god of Warriors, Fire Elementalists, Protection and Smiting Monks, and Command Paragons, and is linked to the Season of the Phoenix in the Elonian calendar.

Balthazar arrived on Tyria carrying the head of his father and leading his fierce hounds, Temar and Tegon, sweeping Orr with a cleansing flame. He proclaimed the world for humanity to take, believing the other races would be easily defeated. When Abaddon fell, Balthazar forged the chains that bound the fallen god in the Realm of Torment. His forces currently battle with his half-brother, Menzies, in the Fissure of Woe. He is greatly revered and celebrated by the Zaishen Order, who host tournaments in Balthazar's name on the Battle Isles.

Depictions of Balthazar usually show him holding a greatsword with his battle hounds at his feet. In Cantha, the greatsword is usually of the single-edged imperial style, and the hounds are usually replaced with winged drakes. Elonian depictions occasionally replace the hounds with other predatory animals, such as lions. When the world has the Favor of the Gods, statues of Balthazar light up with flames burning along the base, and the eyes burn brightly.

### Melandru

*And it was that a tribe of godless humans wandered the land. Where camped did they lay waste, senselessly destroying everything nearby.*

*And so the tribe set out to find another camp, when suddenly sprouted a wall of thorny branches, which blocked their exit.*

*Then saith Ewan, leader of the tribe, "Know ye our ways. Whosoever does magic in this tribe shall be put to death."*

*Yet none comes forward. Then, from the earth grows forth a large tree, and unfurling its branches, reveals the upper torso of a woman. Saith She, "I am Melandru, the Mother of earth and nature. Henceforth I bind ye to these lands. When they suffer, so shall ye suffer."*

*And as She saith, so was it done. From their limbs sprouted branches, and the blood in their veins was the sap of trees. Then was Ewan and his tribe converted, and became they stewards of nature.*

*— Scriptures of Melandru, 48 BE*

Melandru is the Goddess of Nature and Earth, and the eldest of the modern Gods. Many of her followers are Earth Dervishes, Earth Elementalists and Rangers, who maintain shrines to her along the roads to offer travelers food, water, and rest. She is linked to the Season of the Scion in the Dynastic Reckoning.

She was the third god to arrive on Tyria, following Balthazar. From the great trees of Echovald to the Iboga-filled jungles of Elona to the cold, pristine beauty surrounding the Far Shiverpeaks... Melandru's hand touches all. She terraformed Orr into a green and flowering expanse. She urged peace with the races already present on this world, and sought to maintain balance with the destruction in the world.

It is said that the druids of the Maguuma Jungle once worshiped Melandru. Many Canthans believe that Melandru was killed by the Jade Wind, but her more devoted Canthan followers believe that she endues within the crystalline landscape.

Melandru is often depicted as a winged dryad's upper body coming from the trunk of a large plant. Precise details vary from region to region as such: Tyrians have her naturally growing into a tree, whereas Canthans usually depict a more stern figure with a lower half ensconced in Echovald quartz. Elonians use magic to sculpt her shrines from a living tree, usually a mebayah or a rooted dreamflower. When the world has the Favor of the Gods, leaves begin to grow on statues of Melandru, and water begins to flow from the vase she holds.

### Lyssa

*And it was, that a stranger came to the village of Wren seeking shelter and employment. Though young in years, her body was stooped and twisted, her flesh eaten by disease. "Ye have the mark of plague upon ye," said the citizen named Gallrick. "Leave this place lest you sicken our people."*

*"I've lost my family and my home," cried the desperate woman. "Have you no heart?"*

*Yet each person, in turn, did look away.*

*Then from the crowd came a young woman, Sara. She looked upon the woman with pity. "If you need help," said Sara, "I will give it." And Sara did approach the gnarled, bent woman and did offer her a helping hand.*

*Then the sickened woman pulled from her body the robes of plague, revealing Herself to be the goddess Lyssa.*

*The people of Wren fell to their knees, begging Lyssa's mercy. But lifting Sara gently, saith She, "True beauty is measured not by appearance but by actions and deeds. Many have eyes, but few have seen. Of all here, you saw the beauty behind the illusion. And you alone shall be blessed with My gifts."*

*— Scriptures of Lyssa, 45 BE*

Lyssa is the twin Goddess of Beauty and Illusion, individually known as Lyss and Ilya. She is the patron Goddess of Mesmers and Assassins, and is also associated with the Energy Storage techniques of Elementalists and the Mysticism of Dervishes. In the Elonian calendar, she is associated with the Season of the Zephyr.

Lyssa spent time living among the humans, veiled and hidden, in the village of Wren. However, when Arah was completed she was called to join the other Gods. Lyss, half of the twin Goddess, is extremely important to the people of Vabbi, who believe that it was she who shaped their lands, and that they were molded in her own glorious image.

In most of the world, Lyssa is portrayed in the same way: as twin figures of exquisite beauty entwined in an eternal dance. When the world has the Favor of the Gods, a golden light appears around the base of statues of Lyssa, and the statues are enveloped in a brilliant white light, casting off any vegetation that has grown on the statue since the world last held Favor.

### Grenth

*Came then Desmina, scorned and exiled by her people. And in her misery and wretchedness, did Desmina curse the gods for abandoning all who, like her, admired power and ambition.*

*And asketh she, "Where is the god to whom I may give my undying devotion? Where is the god to whom I may beg revenge against those who scorn me?"*

*And rumbled then the earth from far below, and with a terrible groan, split open. The ground grew white with frost and ice, and from forth the frozen earth spilled the rotted, skeletal minions of Grenth.*

*Appeared then the god, and with bony hands outstretched, welcomed the girl into His fold. Saith he, "I am your god. Follow where I lead, come whence I call, and the rotted corpses of the dead will be yours to control." And swearing allegiance in life and beyond, did Desmina thence become the god's first follower.*

*— Scriptures of Grenth, 48 BE*

Grenth is the God of Death and Ice. He is the patron god of Assassins, Water Elementalists, Necromancers, and Ritualists, and is linked to the Season of the Colossus in the Elonian calendar.

He was later elevated to power after seizing control of the Underworld and defeating Dhuum, the previous God of Death. Recently, the forces of Dhuum have grown more powerful and taken back vast stretches of the Underworld, causing Grenth to ask mortal adventurers for aid. Grenth's teachings are celebrated during Wintersday, when his followers compete with Dwayna to determine which god will dominate the coming year.

Grenth is usually depicted as having the body of a man but the skull of a beast (in Canthan depictions, the skull is more draconic), and with the souls of his followers clamouring at his feet for his attention. In Cantha, the faces of these souls are always turned away from Grenth as if in shame. Elonians often leave offerings of bone, ivory and, when times are hard, flesh and sinew at the feet of statues of Grenth. When the world has the Favor of the Gods, mist flows from the base of the statues and their eyes glow brightly.
