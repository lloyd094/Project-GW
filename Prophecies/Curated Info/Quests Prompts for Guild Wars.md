## Ascalon

### Ascalon City

**Barradin's Advance.** <u>Captain Arne</u> has lost contact with <u>Duke Barradin</u> who lead a Vangaurd force across the Wall recently. Perhaps if the party investigates near Hammer Gate in Old Ascalon, they can learn where they might have gone.

(*Related: Eastern Frontier, "Fires in the East"*)

***Cities of Ascalon.** <u>Symon the Scribe</u> is trying to archive the history of Ascalon before it all goes to ruin. Perhaps the party could bring him historical information to record for a small reward, or ask about locations nearby to explore in return for bringing back something important.

**Counting the Fallen.** <u>King Adelbern</u> has commissioned a monument to those who died in the Searing. Unfortunately, the census containing the names of those fallen was lost somewhere in the ruins of Old Ascalon.
