# Story: Prophecies

The way I intend to portray this story is to make it playable as either the main characters (in the vein of actually playing the MMO), or to allow the GM to use the events to influence the world around the party. The party could simply help out with events, ignore everything and just experience the world, or actively work against the events and change history entirely! While I intend to offer as much information and advice as possible to the GM, not all the work will be pre-made for them for alternate routes. Nevertheless, they are greatly encouraged.

This base guideline will be split into different sections. While the story arc has some specifics that are non negotiable, it does not mean the party has to carry them out. The story arcs assume that the party is following the main story.  Additionally, the arcs assume that the players choose to take on the quests (with exceptions). The optional arcs can be used in place of the story arc for the group, or in addition to, within reason.

You will find lots of dialogue contained within - most of this is here to show what was in the base game, and to give the GM some ideas as to how the dialogue may go. It does not need to be strictly followed at all, but may be used verbatim if desired. Simply put, it is included to give an idea of what the NPC has on their mind and is likely to talk about.

Throughout, you will find certain extra marks. Here are explanations for the following:

Storyline: https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Storyline_of_Prophecies

## Act 0: Pre-Searing Ascalon

### Story Arc

**Intro:** *The last day dawns on the Kingdom of Ascalon. It arrives with no fanfare, no tolling of alarms. Those who will remember, will speak fondly of the warm morning breeze. People carry on with their daily lives, unaware that in a short while... Everything they have ever known will come to an end.*

Choose a Beginning:

1. <u>New Recruits:</u> The war against the Charr is taxing to Ascalonians, but they intend to hold the wall no matter the cost. Sir Tydus is recruiting heroes to fight the forces of Charr, at King Adelbern's orders.
2. <u>The Reserves:</u> The party, members of the Ascalonian Army reserves, has been assembled by Sir Tydus to fight against the Charr. The attack is tonight, and he expects the party to be ready in short time.

**Outro:** *It was on that day that day that the Charr discovered a way around the Great Wall. A way to bring it down. This is where the true story begins.* <u>Create description of what happens.</u>

------

### Side Quests 

- Train to better serve the army.
  - Help with a nearby skale infestation.
  - Aid Devona in Lakeside County by checking in at Ashford Abbey.
    - Meerak claims he's received a message from Dwayna showing the charr to have some powerful force. Warn Armin Saberlin in Ascalon City of the danger.
- Profession Trials
  - For those who want to get a feel for things, or better roleplay, meet with their teachers (split group or full group). ie. A/some/all students are attempting to finish up some of their training under their mentor(s).
- Combat training (in the Citadel)
- Other side quests (up to group and GM)

*Figure out what we want here. How much detail do we want to go into?*

### Alternatives

The party could be located anywhere in the game world - this just creates more work for the GM. Listed in **appendix _**, we have compiled some notes on things to keep in mind in regards to what has not happened yet, and the state of the world prior to Act 0 and during.

----

### Notes

Between Act 0 and Act 1 (in game), there is a two year gap. The GM and players may determine what happens during this gap, but they may also choose to live out portions of this time. Events happening during Act 1 obviously don't happen until roughly two years later. However, some suggestions will be listed in **appendix _**.

----

## Act 1: A Kingdom in Despair

### Story Arc

Following The Searing, the kingdom of Ascalon is in despair. Approximately two years later, Ascalon is still holding their ground against the charr as much as possible, but the fight is going nowhere. Additionally, most of the settlements in Ascalon are now ruins. 

#### 1.1 - The Krytan Ambassador*

The party has spent the last two years continuing to serve the army of Ascalon. Upon completion of a recent patrol ending outside the now ruined Ascalon City, they are approached by Captain Osric.

|      | Captain Osric                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"Welcome back! Looks like the patrol went well. You're still in one piece at any rate... Listen, Prince Rurik sent me to ask you a favor."*<br /><br />*You've been in the field, so you probably haven't heard about this, but an ambassador's arrived from our old enemy Kryta. They can help us fight the Charr, but the king won't even talk to him. The prince hasn't been able to make any headway with his father, but he knows the King trusts Tydus, and Tydus trusts you. Would you perhaps talk to Warmaster Tydus about this matter? He's in his usual place in Ascalon City."* |
| Ask  | *"I understand why the king bears a grudge against Kryta. He believes we might have been able to stop the Searing if we'd not spent so many years defending ourselves from Krytan guilds, but by all accounts, times have changed in Kryta. We should at least hear what the ambassador has to say. Please, next time you're in Ascalon City, talk to Warmaster Tydus about this. He trusts you. If you can convince him, he may be able to persuade the king to listen to reason."* |

Upon accepting the quest, Captain Osric thanks them and walks away to take care of other important matters. It would be best to speak with Tydus sooner than later.

By searching Ascalon city, the players eventually find Warmaster Tydus.

|       | Warmaster Tydus                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main  | *"Don't talk to me about that Krytan ambassador! I've been getting an earful from both sides. Do you know why King Adelbern trusts me? Because I know where my loyalties lie. King and country, Balthazar preserve them both! Perhaps joining the Prince's Vanguard has confused you, but Rurik is not the ruler of the kingdom. Now listen to me. The king's already given this matter much consideration, and the likes of you and I best abide by his wisdom."* |
| Cont. | *"I have an important task for you. Please deliver this royal message to Ambassador Zain of Kryta. His camp can be found just outside the city. Go out the western gate to Old Ascalon and head west to find the encampment."<br/><br />"I don't trust these Krytans. I want you to take someone with you in case there's trouble. I'm sure Alesia will be willing to go with you, and she can heal you if need be."* |

If the party asks to help, or the GM wants to add this as a quest, Tydus will assign the party the task of delivering the message. Tydus recommends the party meet with Alesia Baptiste*, a Tyrian monk who may act as a healer for the party. 

As the party ventures outside Ascalon City, they will head towards an encampment nearby. The encampment is located on top of a hill, and centered around an old dead tree. There is a fire burning, and if the party so chooses to listen, they will hear some dialogue between Prince Rurik and Ambassador Zain.

|       | Dialogue                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik | *"Greetings Ambassador Zain. Let me be the first to welcome you to Ascalon."* |
| Zain  | *"Ah, Prince Rurik. I thank you for your kind words. I will admit, I was nervous about this meeting. Our initial reception here in Ascalon City has been...less than warm."* |
| Rurik | *"So I have heard. I apologize for my father. He means well and does what he thinks is best for his country, but sometimes his stubborn memory of the last Guild War gets in his way."* |
| Zain  | *"The days of war between our two nations are over. We are here in the name of Kryta to give aid to Ascalon. We ask for nothing in return, and wish only to be of service."* |
| Rurik | *"We would be foolish to allow our pride to stand in the way of such a generous offer."* |
| Zain  | *"Now I see why the people of Ascalon so admire you, Rurik. When it is your turn, you will be a good king. A good king indeed."* |
| Rurik | *"Thank you, Ambassador. Now I must take my leave. I will talk with the king. Perhaps I can change his mind and gain you access to the city."* |

|      | Ambassador Zain                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Desc | Zain is an ambassador of Kryta and representative of the White Mantle. |
| Main | *"A message with the royal seal? Let's see. Honored Ambassador et cetera...et cetera..."Your request for permission to enter the city and address the people of Ascalon is emphatically denied. This being the fourth such denial, His Majesty bids you reconsider this ill-conceived journey and contemplate a return to Kryta.""<br/><br />"King Adelbern and I have learned very different lessons from the wars of past. Isolation is not the answer. Only in peace and mutual friendship shall we find our salvation. I still have hope that in time, he will realize the truth of this."* |
| Extr | <u>Kryta Status:</u> *"There is peace in Kryta. What more need you hear? The wisdom of men may fail. Place your faith in the Unseen Ones. Life is good for those sheltered by the White Mantle.*<br /><u>Thoughts Toward Ascalon:</u> *"The war between Kryta and Ascalon is over, and both kingdoms have been transformed. Old grudges have no place in this new world. It is time for there to be friendship between us once more."*<br /><u>White Mantle:</u> *The White Mantle serve the Unseen Ones who saved Kryta from the Charr invasion. We have brought peace and stability to the lands of the west. Our fields are no longer ruined by battle, and the ships that ply our ports bring trade, not warfare.*<br /><u>Why Are You Here:</u> *"Confessor Dorian, head of the White Mantle, has foreseen dire times for Ascalon. Troubled by these visions, he sent me, to offer King Adelbern our help in these dark days."* |
| Non  | If the party did not deliver the message to Ambassador Zain, he will simply respond with:<br />*"Please pardon me. It is not that I do not wish to speak with you, but I am on an important diplomatic mission here in Ascalon, and King Adelbern is very wary of foreigners. It might hinder my efforts to be seen talking to you. I hope you understand."* |
| Side | If the party is looking for extra work or wish to help, Zain has a few side quests for the group: <br />**A Mission of Peace** \| **Helping the People of Ascalon** \| **The Ambassador's Quandary** |

----------

#### 1.2 - Defend the Wall

*Chapter Notes: There are plenty of locations that battles can be inserted - for here, the recommended creatures are devourers, gargoyles, and charr. The GM can also provide optional ways to get around certain challenges such as thinking outside the box, giving alternatives, etc.*

Sometime after delivering the message to Ambassador Zain, the group is approached once again by Warmaster Tydus.

|      | Warmaster Tydus                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"There you are! I was asked to pass you a message from Prince Rurik. There's trouble at the Great Northern Wall, and they'd like your help. Squire Zachery is waiting for you at the Wall.<br/><br />One thing before you go... Since Althea's disappearance, the prince has grown increasingly reckless. Be careful, old friend. Ascalon needs you in one piece."* |
| Loca | *"Forgotten how to get to the Great Northern Wall, have you? Head northeast and you'll find it. I believe Squire Zachery is already there, waiting for you."* |

As the group heads northeast from Ascalon City, they will find the Great Northern Wall outpost a short distance away. Inside, they will meet a young squire by name of Zachary, patiently waiting for the group to arrive.

|      | Squire Zachary                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"It's an honor to meet you all. I suppose you're wondering why Prince Rurik asked you here. I'm afraid I can't say, really. Captain Calhaan is in charge, and I'm not so important that they tell me anything, to be honest. I do know there's trouble ahead. You may want to gather some allies before going in to talk to the Captain. He's the sort to send you right into the fray, soon as he sees you."* |

The party will find Captain Calhaan nearby, who will brief them on the situation.

|      | Captain Calhaan                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"We fear the Charr General Bonfaaz Burntfur is planning a mass raid on the Wall. Head north into enemy territory and find out what that mangy beast has planned."* |

The party will then head down the wall's battlements into the northern lands. At the base of the wall are soldiers guarding the gate, some fighting off devourers who got too close. As the group heads north, they will pass devourers, gargoyles, and skirmishes between the two. Eventually to keep heading north, the party will have to get through a gate in some old ruins - there just happens to be some grawl nearby it. 

*Side Quest: Champion of Surmia*

Once past the gate, the party will climb a hill to overlook the charr army they were sent to find. Through one way or another, the Charr army spots the group and starts charging towards them. The group must make it back to the wall and warn Captain Calhaan.

|      | Captain Calhaan                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"You're back. Well done. What news of the Charr?"*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"There are too many - we'll never hold them off! The Wall is lost - we must fall back. Retreat and regroup at the bunkers just north of Fort Ranik. We can't let the Charr make it to the capital!"* |

The group will retreat with the Ascalonian forces to Fort Ranik, thus proceeding directly into the next arc. 

*The GM may wish to add challenges along the way or other optional content. The story continues in Fort Ranik however.*

----------

#### 1.3 - Fort Ranik

Following the escape from the Northern Wall, the army regroups in Fort Ranik. There, the party can find Lord Darrin. The following discussion may carry out:

|      | Lord Darrin                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | **"The Ascalon Army is scattered and in retreat. But small teams are regrouping and making stands against the invaders. If you can push back the Charr, force them out and retake the Wall, Ascalon City will be saved.""I've seen this sort of thing before, and it does not bode well, not at all. What is it you desire my friend?"*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"Today is a dark day in the history of Ascalon. The Charr have breached the Wall again. They burn our homes and threaten to take what little we have left. The guards who man the Wall have fallen back, and the Charr army marches on Ascalon City."*<br /><br />*"The Charr are beasts, but it appears they are not as stupid as many think. They organized a large invasion force and simply overwhelmed the garrison at the Northern Gate.<br/>Prince Rurik is directing an organized defense. Even now, he marches toward the Wall from the capital city of Rin. Even so, Rin is far to the west. By the time he arrives, Ascalon City may have already fallen."*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"Your words are inspiring, but I'm afraid the end of Ascalon is near. How long can we hold out against such a beastly race as the Charr? They have only one goal, and that is to see the end of us all. You've heard the rumors...even Prince Rurik thinks the time has come to abandon the cities and make for the mountain pass."*<br /><br />*"The Ascalon Army is scattered and in retreat. But small teams are regrouping and making stands against the invaders. If you can push back the Charr, force them out and retake the Wall, Ascalon City will be saved."*<br /><br />[GR]<br /><br />*"The events of the next few hours will either be written about in legend or torn from human memory by the claws of the Charr. The choice of which of these things comes to pass is up to you. Good luck."* |

By the end of the discussion, the group should be aware of their goal: to push back the Charr forces. The party will then head out when ready in effort to strike back.

Upon leaving Fort Ranik, the area will be a battlefield - burnt, bloody, and filled with debris. All around are Charr fighting against the Ascalonian forces. On their way north, the party may overhear some members of the militia announcing that the Charr have pushed past the cathedral, thus putting many Ascalonian citizens in danger.

*Side Quest: Deliver A Message To My Wife*

Eventually, the group will come to a hill overlooking a Charr infested valley before the wall. Around this area are Trebuchets, now broken. Near one of the trebuchets is an engineer attempting to repair, but he refuses to speak unless the surrounding area is safe. Once any threats in the immediate area are taken care of, the party can then speak with Siegemaster Lormar.

|      | Siegemaster Lormar                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"Damn Charr snuck up on me while I was repairing this trebuchet. It's missing a release lever, restraining bolt, and an arming crank. Search the other wrecked trebuchets to find those three pieces, and bring them back to me. If you do, we can fix this little lovely, and we'll give those Charr a taste of their own filth!"* |

After the party brings Siegemaster Lormar the required parts, he gets them in place and allows the party to load and fire (if they wish). This results in the death of the Charr party in the valley, making the way clear to get closer to the wall.

As the party moves closer to the wall, there is one more fight to take place: a Charr general and a small band of minions blocks your goal. *Smart players may notice a second trebuchet nearby that will decimate the group in this fight as well, speeding up the final part of the mission.* Once the general is destroyed, the party meets with the Ascalonian army to listen to a speech given by Prince Rurik.

|       | Prince Rurik's Speech                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik | *"The time for action has come. No more cowering behind this wall! From now on, we take the fight to our enemies!"* |
| Guard | *"Prince Rurik! Prince Rurik!"*                              |
| Rurik | *"What is it?"*                                              |
| Guard | *"We are victorious, but it has cost us greatly. During their retreat, the Charr took prisoners. Several of our wounded have been carried off!"* |
| Rurik | *"Ascalon will live in fear of these beasts no more. We march to the north, to free our brothers and take back that which has been taken from us."* |

-------

#### 1.4 - Ruins of Surmia

Following the speech by Rurik, the party is now able to speak with Warmaster Riga, found near Frontier Gate. There, he will tell them to head to Surmia to speak with Captain Miken.

|      | Warmaster Riga                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"You're another one of those Vanguard soldiers looking for Prince Rurik, aren't you? He didn't wait for you, but I think you still have a chance to catch up to him. The prince headed north to pursue the fleeing Charr into the ruins of Surmia. Follow the road from the Frontier Gate to Surmia to rejoin the prince and rescue those carried off by the Charr. I directed Captain Miken up that way not too long ago. He might be able to direct you further."* |
| Ask  | *"I admire Prince Rurik's courage, but chasing the Charr north of the Wall is a fool's errand, if you ask me. Not that you did ask me... If you want to find the prince, follow the road from the Frontier Gate to Surmia. Once there, check with Captain Miken for the prince's exact whereabouts."* |

Along the road towards Surmia, there are several groups of grawl that the party may choose to either engage in combat or sneak past. Once outside Surmia, the party can find Captain Miken who will instruct the party to assist Prince Rurik in a rescue mission.

|      | Captain Miken                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"You've arrived just in time. The prince has already begun scouting the path, and from what I can see, he is prepared to pursue the Charr on his own if need be. He asked that I remain in this area and direct everyone I can find to join him, and I am doing my best to carry out his orders.<br/><br />Please gather a force as quickly as you can and see if you can catch up with Prince Rurik before he tries to face the Charr army on his own!"* |

When the party is ready, they will find Prince Rurik waiting for them just outside the encampment. The mission is best split into three sections: before the drawbridge, the drawbridge, and after the drawbridge. The journey north into Surmia territory is dangerous, resulting in many devourer and charr encounters. Along the way, Rurik laments about how sad it is to see Ascalon in ruins.

In the first section, the party will come across three different charr encampments, each with prisoners that Rurik will want to free and send back towards the wall. For the third encampment, the party will meet Errol, and the following conversation will take place.

|       | Dialogue                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik | *"Gods! How long have you been out here, man?"*              |
| Erol  | *"I don't know. Since my unit was taken at the end of the last Guild War. Since the sky rained fire and destroyed Ascalon."* |
| Rurik | *"You've been here since the Searing? That's over two years! Are there others?"* |
| Erol  | *"Yes. The remnants of my unit, the Flaming Scepter Mages."* |
| Rurik | *"Soldiers who have been slaves since the end of the war?"*  |
| Erol  | *"They're being held in the ruins of the old capital, Drascir."* |
| Rurik | *"Then we go to Drascir."*                                   |
| Erol  | *"My Lord, night is falling. If we don't head for the Wall now, we may all be captured."* |
| Rurik | *"I understand the dangers, but Balthazar be damned if I allow those soldiers to remain slaves to the Charr."* |
| Erol  | *"I can show you where they are being held."*                |
| Rurik | *"Very good. We head north then. To Drascir."*               |

The party will then head north and eventually come to a raised drawbridge for some old ruins, separated by a river of tar. Rurik will task the party with finding a way to lower the bridge while he and Erol wait. The lever can be found on the opposite side of the river, near the drawbridge itself. Once the drawbridge is lowered, Rurik and Erol will cross. A group of Charr can be seen down below in the following valley.

*Side Quest: Follow the Flame Keeper*

|      | Prince Rurik                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main | *"This is a fight we cannot win. We must avoid a confrontation with that group at all costs. Come with me. I grew up in this city, and I know a way around them. Our only chance is to run for the obelisks in the ruins of the Royal Academy."* |

Rurik will then proceed to lead the party down into the valley to a small group of charr (not the large one previously spotted) who are guarding three mages. Upon liberating the mages, everyone runs towards the obelisks in the old Royal Academy courtyard and Rurik works on opening the door through chants. In this final stand against the charr, the mages will assist in fighting off waves of enemies - how many and how hard is up to the GM or random rolls of dice. `INSERT RULE?`

Eventually, Rurik finally gets the doors open, revealing a portal inside `INSERT PICTURE`. Rurik will yell for everyone to get inside as a swarms of charr pour into the courtyard. The party slams the door shut just in time, only to hear the efforts of the charr trying to get in from the other side.

|       | Dialogue                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rurik | *"That was closer than I'd hoped."*<br /><br />Gestures to the portal.<br /><br />*"This portal will take us to the Academy at Nolani. From there we can make it to the Wall and cross over to Rin. We should hurry though - the magical wards will hold back the Charr, but not for long."* |
| Erol  | *"Wait, my lord. Come, look at what I have found."*<br /><br />Gesturing towards an old horn relic. Rurik hurries over to look. |
| Rurik | *"Is that...?"*                                              |
| Erol  | *"Yes, my prince. I believe it is the mouthpiece for the fabled horn, Stormcaller! With this weapon we could destroy the Charr once and for all. Ascalon could be saved."* |
| Rurik | *I have heard the stories of the horn's magic, but let us not be too hasty. If this is what you say it is, then we must get it to Rin. We'll see for ourselves how much power this Stormcaller has.*<br /><br />*"Come. We'll take this to my father, King Adelbern. Surely he will know if discovering this weapon is our salvation... or simply too late. Either way, staying here will surely be the death of us. Quickly, through the portal!"* |
