# Prophecies - Act 0

## Act 0: Pre-Searing Ascalon

### Story Arc

**Intro:** *The last day dawns on the Kingdom of Ascalon. It arrives with no fanfare, no tolling of alarms. Those who will remember, will speak fondly of the warm morning breeze. People carry on with their daily lives, unaware that in a short while... Everything they have ever known will come to an end.*

Choose a Beginning:

1. <u>New Recruits:</u> The war against the Charr is taxing to Ascalonians, but they intend to hold the wall no matter the cost. Sir Tydus is recruiting heroes to fight the forces of Charr, at King Adelbern's orders.
2. <u>The Reserves:</u> The party, members of the Ascalonian Army reserves, has been assembled by Sir Tydus to fight against the Charr. The attack is tonight, and he expects the party to be ready in short time.

**Outro:** *It was on that day that day that the Charr discovered a way around the Great Wall. A way to bring it down. This is where the true story begins.* <u>Create description of what happens.</u>

- Other side quests (up to group and GM)

*Figure out what we want here. How much detail do we want to go into?*

### Alternatives

The party could be located anywhere in the game world - this just creates more work for the GM. Listed in **appendix _**, we have compiled some notes on things to keep in mind in regards to what has not happened yet, and the state of the world prior to Act 0 and during.

### Notes

Between Act 0 and Act 1 (in game), there is a two year gap. The GM and players may determine what happens during this gap, but they may also choose to live out portions of this time. Events happening during Act 1 obviously don't happen until roughly two years later. However, some suggestions will be listed in **appendix _**.
