# Prophecies - Introduction and Notes

The way I intend to portray this story is to make it playable as either the main characters (in the vein of actually playing the MMO), or to allow the GM to use the events to influence the world around the party. The party could simply help out with events, ignore everything and just experience the world, or actively work against the events and change history entirely! While I intend to offer as much information and advice as possible to the GM, not all the work will be pre-made for them for alternate routes. Nevertheless, they are greatly encouraged.

This base guideline will be split into different sections. While the story arc has some specifics that are non negotiable, it does not mean the party has to carry them out. The story arcs assume that the party is following the main story.  Additionally, the arcs assume that the players choose to take on the quests (with exceptions). The optional arcs can be used in place of the story arc for the group, or in addition to, within reason.

You will find lots of dialogue contained within - most of this is here to show what was in the base game, and to give the GM some ideas as to how the dialogue may go. It does not need to be strictly followed, but may be used verbatim if desired. Simply put, it is included to give an idea of what the NPC has on their mind and is likely to talk about.

There are plenty of NPCs given here, carried over from the original game. Explanations and information about the NPCs will not be given in this section, but will instead be in another section for ease of access. References will be given for specific page numbers on final product however.

Throughout, you will find certain extra marks. Here are explanations for the following:

| Symbol | Definition                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| " * "  | Blank Slate NPC: This NPC might hold a name and a few minor descriptions, but the GM is free to develop/use this character as they please. These NPCs may be disposable or returning at GM discretion. |
| [GR]   | **Group Response**: This may be optional depending on how the GM words things. Sometimes a response is absolutely necessary, other times it is completely avoidable. |
