# The Classes of Guild Wars

This document focuses on the Classes of Guild Wars, figuring out how each prevails over others and determining the mechanics of the "Dual Class" or "Dual Professions" system.

[TOC]

------------

## In General

Classes in Guild Wars are divided into "Professions." Each character has two professions to work with, giving customizability to the players. In honor of this system, we plan to keep professions system of Guild Wars but adding our own twist as well.

### Primary vs Secondary Professions

To give even more uniqueness to the blend of professions chosen, we've decided to make a distinction between Primary and Secondary professions. Thus, a X/Y profession will be different from a Y/X profession, even though both professions X and Y are used. To create this distinction, attributes and other stats will be more heavily influenced by the primary class.

### In Transition

Because the first focus of the project is a conversion to D&D5, we will be basing this "Professions" system off the the Class and Sub-Class system. In this sense, the "Primary Profession" will be the "Class," and each "Secondary Profession" will be a "Sub-Class." Every other profession than the Primary will be an option represented as a sub-class.

### Leveling Up

To keep the sense of profession, and to allow players to accustom to the classes, players will have the Primary race only until the third level. Once the secondary profession is taken, it stays until the player decides to change it by "Ascension." *Rules yet to be determined.*

---------

## Overview

Each class combination will have a unique name in reference - in other words, the character's class can be referred to by the Sub-Class name.

 Certain classes are "exclusive" to the MMO expansions, and are thus tailored to those campaigns when converted to TTRPG. While not impossible to play the specific classes in that campaign, it is recommended to give a good reason as to why the character is what they are. Notes will be given in each of the classes to better aid the players and GM in deciding. The final decision of what classes are allowed will be left to the GM.

For planning and ease of use, here is a table that will give the example. *Subject to Change*

## Professions Comparison

As borrowed from the GW1 Wiki, this helps show an overview of what each class can do. This table can be used to help design the D&D5 professions to somewhat reflect how the game class worked.

## Primary Professions

### Elementalist

**Elementalists (midline)** in a party are usually expected to do heavy damage. [Fire Magic](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fire_Magic) is most typical in PvE for its high damage AoE spells, but other builds will still generally be accepted as long as they have a high damage output. Elementalists are also sometimes used for snaring, using [Water Magic](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Water_Magic) spells to prevent mobs from dispersing away from AoE damage. Elementalists function in some rare cases as frontline tanks themselves, using [Earth Magic](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Earth_Magic)-based enchantments to increase armor. When facing areas full of high-armor melee enemies, remember that they can support the party by spreading generous amounts of damage mitigation or amplification: Blindness, Weakness, and Cracked Armor, as well as [ward](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ward) spells from Earth Magic line.  With their high energy reserves, Elementalists are sometimes combined with a Monk secondary to become powerful backline healers.

Elementalists *summon the powers of earth, air, fire, and water and command them at will. They can inflict more damage in a single strike than any other profession. Earth Magic summons quakes and eruptions, encases enemies in stone, or protects allies. Air Magic harnesses the power of tempests to strike foes down with lightning or enable allies to run like the wind. Fire Magic manifests flames, fireballs, molten lava, and even meteors to burn enemies to a crisp. Water Magic conjures mist and ice to slow enemy movement and attacks, blur vision, protect allies against magic, and inflict cold damage on enemies. Elementalists have access to Energy regenerating skills, and when chosen as a primary character, they can increase their maximum Energy over time. The wise Elementalist avoids becoming surrounded, but keeps a local area-of-effect spell on hand just in case.*

*The master of arcane lore and magical aptitude, the Elementalist calls upon the power of fire, earth, air and water to obliterate enemies.*

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guide_to_playing_as_an_elementalist

| Attribute      | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Energy Storage | Energy Storage increases your [character](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Character)'s maximum [energy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Energy) by 3 per rank, and improves skills that help you regenerate energy. |
| Air Magic      | Points to Air Magic increases the duration and effectiveness of your air skills, which pierce armor, cause [Blindness](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blind), and knock down enemies, stunning them. |
| Earth Magic    | Build up Earth Magic to increase the duration and effectiveness of your earth skills, which can protect both you and your allies or attack your opponents, ignoring armor level. |
| Fire Magic     | Improve Fire Magic to increase the duration and effectiveness of your fire skills, which inflict fire damage and can affect large areas. |
| Water Magic    | Allocate points to Water Magic to increase the duration and effectiveness of your water skills, which slow enemy movement. |

----------

### Mesmer

**Mesmers (midline)** are more situation-specific, and should know the enemies beforehand in order to plan their build accordingly. Because they are more difficult to play effectively, they are also a rarer PvE profession. Mesmers shine when it comes to [shutdown](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shutdown), via interrupts and hexes, although other builds are viable. [Inform](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ping) your group of your role in the upcoming fights.

Mesmers *are masters of illusion and control, subverting the enemy’s Energy for their own use, and that of their allies. Combined with any other profession, their skills provide excellent support, turning enemies’ powers against them and changing the very fabric of reality to hinder foes and help allies. Mesmers have the ability to cast spells quickly, which can make all the difference in the heat of battle. Their powers of domination allow them to take control of enemy skills and Energy. Their unique illusionary talents can slow or even halt enemy movement and skill casting, or cause imaginary illnesses that drain Health and Energy from foes while healing and energizing allies. While Mesmers are not known for brute strength, their ability to confuse, distract, and drain the enemy’s resources more than compensates.*

A master of illusion, misdirection, and control, the Mesmer subverts the damage-dealing capabilities of others, manipulating their perceptions to achieve personal goals.

| Profession        | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fast Casting      | Fast Casting decreases the activation time of your Spells and Signets. (No effect for non-Mesmer skills with an activation time less than 2 seconds.) In PvE, each rank of Fast Casting decreases the recharge time for your Mesmer Spells by 3% |
| Domination Magic  | Increases the duration and effectiveness of your Domination spells, which allow you to disrupt and damage your enemies for their actions. |
| Illusion Magic    | Increases the duration and effectiveness of your Illusion spells, which deceive your enemies and hinder their movement, attacks, and ability to cast spells. |
| Inspiration Magic | Increases the duration and effectiveness of your Inspiration spells, which steal Energy from enemies, remove enchantments, and prevent damage. |

-----

### Monk

**Monks (backline)** normally have a focus on keeping the party alive. If you are not the only monk, coordinate with the other monk(s) whether you use [healing](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Healing_Prayers) or [protection](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Protection_Prayers). Usually it is easiest to have one of each. *Definitely* tell your party if you plan to be a non-healing [Smiting Prayers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Smiting_Prayers) monk.

Monks *employ a direct conduit to the gods, and the answers to their prayers come in the form of healing and protection for their allies and damage to their enemies. Combined with any other profession, Monks can alternate between supporting their party and dealing damage to opponents. Monks enjoy Divine Favor, which provides extra healing power, while their healing and Protection Prayers help to keep their allies strong and healthy. Smiting Prayers, on the other hand, call down divine anger on enemies, exacting holy damage that ignores armor, though damage-dealing is not the Monk’s specialty. What Monks lack in firepower they make up for with their unparalleled gift for keeping their allies alive.*

*The servant of divine spirits, the Monk uses prayer to protect, preserve, and restore the well-being of companions.*

| Attribute          | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Divine Favor       | This attribute provides a healing bonus to all Monk spells that target allies, and increases the duration and effectiveness of spells that help you call forth divine powers to aid your allies. |
| Healing Prayers    | Points allocated to Healing Prayers increase the duration and effectiveness of spells that allow you to heal yourself and your allies. |
| Smiting Prayers    | Smiting Prayers increase the duration and effectiveness of skills that inflict damage on the enemy. Smiting Prayers are especially effective against the undead. |
| Protection Prayers | Allocate points to Protection Prayers to increase the duration and effect of your Protection spells, which help protect you and your allies from harm. |

-----------

### Necromancer

**Necromancers (midline)** are usually expected to play a straight damage dealer (e.g. with [Spiteful Spirit](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spiteful_Spirit)) or to boost the frontline via being a minion master. They can also be a party battery through a [Blood is Power](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blood_is_Power) build, where they power spellcasters with high energy regeneration. Tell your party what you plan on doing, especially if there is another necro around. Necromancers not falling into one of those two builds will often have a hard time finding a group; be prepared to explain why you use another build if you do so.

Necromancers *, calling on the spirits of the dead, and even death itself, to overpower enemies and assist allies. In sacrificing Health and taking curses and diseases upon themselves, they can deal large amounts of damage to those foolish enough to oppose them. Dead and dying enemies become unwilling allies in their hands. Necromancers have the singular ability to absorb Energy from an enemy’s death, and can raise a fighting force from the corpses of their foes. Curses, which often cost the Necromancer dearly, exact an even greater toll from enemies, who find that their Enchantments and healing skills are rendered useless. Due to the sacrificial nature of their methods, Necromancers must practice patience and self-discipline to survive.*

*One who has learned to draw power from the blood sacrifice and communion with death, the Necromancer uses black magic to cast curses and raise undead minions.*

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guide_to_playing_as_a_necromancer

| Attribute    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Soul Reaping | For each point of Soul Reaping, you gain 1 Energy whenever a non-Spirit creature near you dies. You may only gain Energy in this way 3 times every 15 seconds. |
| Curses       | This attribute increases the duration and effectiveness of your Curse skills, which reduce your enemies’ effectiveness in battle. |
| Blood Magic  | Blood Magic increases the duration and effectiveness of skills that steal Health from your enemies. |
| Death Magic  | Increases the duration and effectiveness of skills that deal cold and shadow damage to enemies as well as those that increase the effectiveness of your undead minions. The higher the Death Magic Attribute is, the more undead servants you may control at one time. |

----------

### Ranger

**Rangers (midline)** are often expected to either deal damage via [Barrage](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Barrage) (or similar skills) or to shutdown spellcasting via [Broad Head Arrow](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Broad_Head_Arrow) or other bow attack interrupts. They are the most common pullers in the group as they can use their bow and run back to bring back a small group of monsters while tanking fairly well with their high armor and efficient defensive stances such as  [Whirling Defense](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Whirling_Defense) or [Lightning Reflexes](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lightning_Reflexes). If you play a non-bow ranger (e.g. [touch ranger](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Touch_ranger) or [trapper](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Trapper)) tell your party before starting. Also inform them if you plan on bringing any [spirits](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spirit).

Rangers *are unique in their ability to succeed with the help of, or even in spite of, their environment.* [Nature rituals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nature_rituals) *allow them to manipulate the environment to hinder their enemies, or borrow the very power of creation to heal and aid their allies. They favor long-range combat, the* [bow](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bow) *being their weapon of choice, and can be especially effective from elevated locations such as bridges and cliffs. They are the only* [profession](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Profession) *with the ability to* [charm animals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charm_Animal)*, which then accompany them on their travels and assist them in battle, gaining* [experience](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Experience) *and* [levels](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Level) *over time. Rangers are also blessed with survival* [skills](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Skills) *that help keep them alive by causing* [regeneration](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Regeneration) *of health.*

*An agile and wily survivor, the Ranger specializes in archery, beast mastery, and attunement to nature.*

| Attribute           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Expertise           | Points into Expertise decrease the Energy cost by 4% of your [attacks](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Attack_Skill), [Rituals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Rituals), [Touch Skills](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Touch_Skills) and [Ranger Skills](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List_of_ranger_skills). |
| Beast Mastery       | Beast Mastery increases the damage dealt by your [animal companion](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Animal_companion) and its chance to inflict a critical hit. Many Ranger skills, especially those related to making your animal companion stronger, become more effective with higher Beast Mastery. |
| Marksmanship        | Improving Marksmanship increases basic bow damage, and increases damage dealt by bow skills, it also affects the chance of a critical hit. It is the base attribute for most bow skills. |
| Wilderness Survival | Wilderness Survival improves defensive [Stances](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Stances), [Preparations](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Preparations), and [Traps](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Traps), as well as some nature rituals. |

----------

### Warrior

**Warriors (frontline)** are the usual tanks and often the pullers. Your party will expect you to bring a bow for pulling and at least some means of staying alive under fire. If there is more than one tank-worthy character in the party, agree beforehand on who will tank; non-tanking warriors can focus on damage or condition inflicting.

Warriors rely on stout hearts, brute strength, and melee weapons to subdue their enemies and protect their allies. They generally disdain long-range warfare, preferring instead to charge directly into the fray swinging their weapon of choice. They can take a beating unlike anyone else. Warriors are equally comfortable wielding axe, hammer, or sword, though many choose to master one weapon over all others. Many Warrior skills require adrenaline, which builds up during combat to enable those skills, and usually results in major damage. Defensive tactics help the Warrior to avoid damage and protect allies, but Strength is the Warrior’s biggest asset, allowing this hero to do more damage with every attack. 

 *The mightiest of mighty, the bravest of the brave, the Warrior is the master of melee combat and heavy armor.*

### *Assassin*

**Assassins (frontline)** are typically hit-and-run experts, and usually avoid staying in melee range for extended periods due to their lower armor. Assassins can employ shadow steps or speed boosts for hit and run tactics (commonly to quickly [gank](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gank) an enemy healer or simply get an early kill), or use defensive skills and self heals if they intend to stay in melee longer. Some Assassin even use ranged weapons to stay out of melee range but still benefit from [Critical Strikes](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Critical_Strikes); there's even a [crit-based skill](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Way_of_the_Master) designed specifically for non-dagger assassins. In high-end areas, assassins focused on [Shadow Arts](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shadow_Arts) can make very efficient tanks.

*The Assassin walks the shadows, a deadly viper ready to strike at the heart when the enemy least expects it, nowhere and everywhere all at once. Assassins are masters of their chosen weapon, the* [dagger](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Daggers)*, and are expert at inflicting Critical Strikes that cause massive damage. The Assassin is trained to efficiently link attacks together in a chain that does not give the enemy a chance to hit back. They have mastered the ability to move as shadows—Assassins wear only lightweight* [armor](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Armor) *and prefer to avoid* [damage](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Damage) *by not being there when the enemy’s strike lands. Their other magical skills include* [Hexes](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hex_spell) *that lower the target’s defenses and protect the Assassin from harm.*

A swift, silent master of shadows, daggers, and death. The Assassin can chain together increasingly deadly strikes that target a foe's critical areas, killing quickly and efficiently.

| Attribute        | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Critical Strikes | For each point spent on this primary attribute, the Assassin gains an additional 1% chance to score a [critical hit](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Critical_hit). Assassins can also gain [Energy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Energy) whenever they score a critical hit in this way. The higher the rank, the more energy gained per critical hit. |
| Dagger Mastery   | Increasing the Dagger Mastery attribute boosts the damage the Assassin inflicts with daggers and the chance to land a critical hit with a dagger. Many skills, especially dagger attack skills, become more effective with increased Dagger Mastery. This attribute also improves your chance of performing a [Double Attack](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Double_strike) and striking with both daggers at once. |
| Deadly Arts      | Increase the Deadly Arts attribute to improve the duration and effectiveness of Hexes and other skills that make a single enemy vulnerable to the Assassin’s strikes and many [half range spells](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Half_ranged). |

### *Ritualist*

**Ritualists (midline or backline)**, as a versatile profession which can support damage and healing both, make sure the party knows what it is getting. If you plan on using spirits, such as those summoned by the popular [Signet of Spirits](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Signet_of_Spirits), you may want to bring [Summon Spirits](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Summon_Spirits) to keep up with your moving group. If a party has more than one ritualist, they need to check the builds and exclude any duplication in [binding rituals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Binding_ritual).

*Ritualists channel other-worldly energies that summon allies from the void and employ mystic* [binding rituals](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Binding_ritual) *that bend those allies to the Ritualist's will. They hood their eyes to better commune with spirits that grant great power and protection to Ritualists and their comrades. The energy they channel drives Ritualist skills which enhance the deadliness of an ally's weapon and wreak havoc on an enemy's health. The Ritualist can also use the remains of the dead to defend the living-not by reanimating corpses as a* [Necromancer](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Necromancer) *would, but through the ritual use of urns and ashes. Where the* [Ranger](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ranger) *lives as one with the spirit world, the Ritualist can and will be its master.*

A living conduit to the Spirit world, the Ritualist spawns powerful Spirit allies that inflict harm on foes, and can channel restorative magic that heals and protects injured companions.

| Spawning Power    | For each rank of Spawning Power you have, creatures you create (or animate) have 4% more [Health](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Health), and weapon Spells you cast last 4% longer. Some Ritualist skills, especially those related to Spirit creatures, become more effective with higher Spawning Power. |
| Channeling Magic  | No inherent effect. Many Ritualist skills, especially those related to lightning [damage](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Damage) and [energy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Energy), become more effective with higher Channeling Magic. |
| Communing         | No inherent effect. Many Ritualist skills, especially those related to summoning spirits, become more effective with higher Communing. |
| Restoration Magic | No inherent effect. Many Ritualist skills, especially those related to [healing](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Healing), [life stealing](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Life_stealing) and defense, become more effective with higher Restoration Magic. |

### <u>Dervish</u>

**Dervishes (frontline)**, despite having low armor, are a melee profession. Therefore, you will be expected to soak up some damage on your own. Bring a decent [self heal](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Self_heal), but don't neglect your damage output, unless you are the designated tank.  Dervishes can use a multitude of enchantments to either boost damage or defensive capabilities.

*Serving the gods as holy warriors, dervishes stand confidently in the whirlwind of conflict. Martial techniques perfected in the deserts of Elona allow a Dervish’s scythe to lash out quickly at multiple opponents, surrounding the holy warrior with a swath of destruction. Initiates often learn spells of self-protection, prayers that rush a combatant into battle, and invocations that empower attacks with elemental fury. Masters of the profession can assume the form of a god, enacting divine will with holy blessings. Keenly aware of the conditions of a fight, a Dervish can reap great benefits by using multiple Enchantments. Wandering the savannahs and deserts of Elona, the faithful Dervish chants prayers to the earth and wind... and the fury of the sandstorm answers in response.*

*Bolstered by the blessings of the gods, these holy warriors reap the benefits of multiple Enchantments. With a sharpened scythe, the Dervish can unleash a whirlwind of destruction.*

Many skills, especially scythe attack skills, become more effective with higher Scythe Mastery. When attacking with a scythe, you strike up to three adjacent foes in front of you. |
| Wind Prayers   | This attribute increases the duration and effectiveness of the Dervish's Wind Prayer skills, including prayers that speed movement and lash enemies with cold damage. |

### <u>Paragon</u>

- Spear Paladin

**Paragons (midline)** can produce decent damage, but shine in a support role, bringing skills that benefit most of the party members (mostly damage reduction via ["There's Nothing to Fear!"](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/%22There%27s_Nothing_to_Fear!%22) and the warrior skill ["Save Yourselves!"](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/%22Save_Yourselves!%22), but also Arias for spell casters, Anthems for physical damage dealers, ["They're on Fire!"](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/%22They%27re_on_Fire!%22) if the party can cause a reasonable amount of [burning](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Burning), etc). Bringing [Signet of Return](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Signet_of_Return) or ["We Shall Return!"](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/%22We_Shall_Return!%22) can also help the party, as they are reusable resurrection skills.  Paragons also have a niche in party-wide movement speed boosting with [Incoming](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Incoming) and [Fall Back](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fall_Back).

Paragons are the guardian angels of Elona, humanity’s champions against malefic threats. They rally the valiant with Shouts and Chants, aiding heroes, henchmen, and other adventurers through inspiration and motivation. A Paragon’s best weapons rely on an insightful mind, a courageous spirit, and a charismatic voice. Many Paragons also arm themselves with a spear and shield, striking from a distance as they shout their battle cries. Through insight, they help others resist Hexes and Conditions, echoing their commands across the field of battle (in fact, some “Echo” abilities renew themselves each time a Chant or Shout ends). When all hell breaks loose, a commanding Paragon shines as a beacon of light, driving back the forces of darkness. 

*With a commanding voice and charismatic presence, the Paragon rallies the valiant through inspiration, motivation, and leadership.*
