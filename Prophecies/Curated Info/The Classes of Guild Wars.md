# The Classes of Guild Wars

This document focuses on the Classes of Guild Wars, figuring out how each prevails over others and determining the mechanics of the "Dual Class" or "Dual Professions" system.

## In General

Classes in Guild Wars are divided into "Professions." Each character has two professions to work with, giving customizability to the players. In honor of this system, we plan to keep professions system of Guild Wars but adding our own twist as well.

### Primary vs Secondary Professions

To give even more uniqueness to the blend of professions chosen, we've decided to make a distinction between Primary and Secondary professions. Thus, a X/Y profession will be different from a Y/X profession, even though both professions X and Y are used. To create this distinction, attributes and other stats will be more heavily influenced by the primary class.

### In Transition

Because the first focus of the project is a conversion to D&D5, we will be basing this "Professions" system off the the Class and Sub-Class system. In this sense, the "Primary Profession" will be the "Class," and each "Secondary Profession" will be a "Sub-Class." Every other profession than the Primary will be an option represented as a sub-class.

### Leveling Up

To keep the sense of profession, and to allow players to accustom to the classes, players will have the Primary race only until the third level. Once the secondary profession is taken, it stays until the player decides to change it by "Ascension." *Rules yet to be determined.*

## Overview

Each class combination will have a unique name in reference - in other words, the character's class can be referred to by the Sub-Class name.

 Certain classes are "exclusive" to the MMO expansions, and are thus tailored to those campaigns when converted to TTRPG. While not impossible to play the specific classes in that campaign, it is recommended to give a good reason as to why the character is what they are. Notes will be given in each of the classes to better aid the players and GM in deciding. The final decision of what classes are allowed will be left to the GM.

For planning and ease of use, here is a table that will give the example. *Subject to Change*
