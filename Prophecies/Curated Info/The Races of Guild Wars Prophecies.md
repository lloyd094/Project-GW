# The Races of Guild Wars Prophecies

This document is to list the potentially playable races in the Guild Wars Prophecies campaign. While other races exist, they are not in the story of Prophcies or in Tyria, and will thus be saved until later to prevent the scope of the project from over expanding.

[TOC]

## In General

In the MMO, GW1 only allowed the player to have characters of the Human race, either due to design to allow simplicity and focus on other areas of the game, or because of how broad the scope could easily become to correctly add other races. As a TTRPG, players have significant amounts of freedom with gameplay choices, and limiting them to one single race would be very limiting. While the choice of non-human races to play will require a little more imagination of the player to explain how/why they are there, it is not impossible and will bring in many different ways to experience the story and world of Guild Wars.

## Notes

- While both Asura and Norn exist, they do not show up until the EOTN expansion - thus they will not be considered, though they could be playable.
- Both the Forgotten and the Mursaat are ignored as playable races because the populations are so small and/or not congruent with playable races.

### Harathi (?)

(Borrowed from GW2)

Harathi are one of the [centaur](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Centaur) tribes who have entered an alliance with the [Modniir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Modniir) of the [Shiverpeak Mountains](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains). The Harathi are the largest of the three tribes in the alliance, and thus make up the bulk of their army. They're highly organized and are the engineers and scholars of the alliance, being the force behind the centaurs various siege weaponry. Despite this, they, like the [Tamini](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tamini) were forced into the alliance with the Modniir out of fear of their leader, [Ulgoth the Mighty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_Modniir_Ulgoth). 

The Harathi were, in the past, dwellers of the northern [Maguuma Jungle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Maguuma_Jungle).

### Losaru

The Losaru pride are equine [Centaurs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Centaur) that thrive throughout the [Crystal Desert](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert) and look like their relatives in [Elona](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elona). Like other centaur prides, they are dangerous and similar to the [Veldrunner](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Veldrunner). Some Losaru, specifically the [Orshad Raiders](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Orshad_Raiders), are known to eat human flesh.

### Modniir (?)

The Modniir is a pride of [Centaurs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Centaur) that live in regions of the [Shiverpeak Mountains](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains), such as [Drakkar Lake](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Drakkar_Lake), [Norrhart Domains](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Norrhart_Domains) and [Varajar Fells](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Varajar_Fells). Modniir usually are seen hunting in small groups, usually consisting of three or four Modniirs, but can occasionally be seen in large groups.

## Charr

Split into Legions (Groups) and Warbands (subgroups)

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Category:Charr_culture

### Ash Legion

The Ash Legion is one of the four [High Legions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Legion) of the [charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr). The Ash Legion is famed for its [stalkers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr_Stalker) and [Assassins](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Assassin). Known members of its primus [warband](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Warband) include [Ghast Ashpyre](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ghast_Ashpyre) and [Rox Ashreign](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Rox_Ashreign). It is not known whether [War Ashenskull](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/War_Ashenskull) belonged to the Ash warband or the hypothetical Ashen warband, as charr surnames generally use the warband's name as a prefix.

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ash_Legion

### Blood Legion

The Blood Legion is one of the four [High Legions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Legions) of the [Charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr). The Blood Legion is famed for its members' fierceness and proficiency in melee combat. Known members of its primus [warband](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Warband) include [Blaze Bloodbane](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blaze_Bloodbane), [Kaargoth Bloodclaw](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kaargoth_Bloodclaw), [Torg Bloodspine](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Torg_Bloodspine) and [Garfazz Bloodfang](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Garfazz_Bloodfang).

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blood_Legion

### Flame Legion

The Flame Legion is one of the four [High Legions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Legions) of the [Charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr). The Flame Legion is renowned for its members' magical prowess and is most commonly associated with the [Shaman caste](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shaman_caste). Known members of its primus warband include [Chaelse Flameshielder](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Chaelse_Flameshielder), [Tenagg Flametroller](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tenagg_Flametroller) and [Tyndir Flamecaller](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyndir_Flamecaller). 

The [Burnt Warband](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Burnt_Warband) is one of the most prominent warbands in the Flame Legion. This is due to the Burnt Warband being the group of charr which found their gods, the [Titans](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Titan), at [Hrangmer](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hrangmer) 200 years before [the Searing](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Searing). When the Burnt Warband brought back the knowledge of their "new gods," the Flame Legion quickly took control over the other High Legions through the Shamans of the other three High Legions. 

The Flame Legion was the main reason why the Charr were able to cast the ritual of the Searing and attack [Ascalon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascalon), [Kryta](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kryta), and [Orr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Orr) simultaneously. It wasn't until the fall of [Hierophant Burntsoul](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hierophant_Burntsoul) that the Flame Legion started to lose its grip on the rest of the Charr. Because of the events brought forth by the Flame Legion and the Shaman caste, the Flame Legion were considered the most powerful Charr legion and has been the closest to subjugating the other legions since the fall of the [Khan-Ur](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Khan-Ur). 

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Flame_Legion

### Iron Legion

The Iron Legion is one of the four [High Legions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Legions) of the [Charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr). The Iron Legion is known for its [Siege Devourers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Siege_Devourer), catapults, towers, and other mechanical works. No members of its primus [warband](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Warband) are known to have been encountered as of yet.

## Dredge

On the northern continent of [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria), the mole-people known as the Dredge are a pitiable race, enslaved by the wicked [Stone Summit](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Stone_Summit) [dwarves](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dwarf) and ready to fight alongside any who will help free them from their masters’ whips. In the [Echovald Forest](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Echovald_Forest) of [Cantha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cantha), a few small colonies of escaped Dredge jealously defend their prized freedom. The offspring of a few desperate escapees from the [Shiverpeaks](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains) who tunneled for hundreds of miles to reach their strange new home, these Dredge have no reason to feel any friendship toward humans or anyone else—they escaped slavery on their own, and plan to establish their race anew in the petrified woodlands. 

Dredge villages are marked by large dirt mounds. The mole-people live primarily in the tunnel networks linking the mounds together. Those who underestimate the ferocity and aggressiveness of the Canthan Dredge do so at their peril.

## Dwarf

Two Factions:

### Deldrimor

Deldrimor is a kingdom of Dwarves residing in the Shiverpeak Mountains that are ruled by a king. They are very friendly towards other races and passage through the harsh mountain range is welcome to anyone who is a friend of Deldrimor or an enemy to the Stone Summit. They hold a capital in [Thunderhead Keep](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Thunderhead_Keep_(outpost)).

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Deldrimor

### Stone Summit

The Stone Summit is a xenophobic faction which has recently broke away from the Deldrimor dwarves while being led by Dagnar Stonepate. They have had some recent successes in seizing power and resources from the Deldrimor Dwarves, most notably in claiming the vast mine of Sorrow's Furnace, which became their main base.

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Stone_Summit

---------

## Human

Humans are one of the most widespread and influential [species](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Species) in the world of [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)). They are spread throughout the world of Tyria, including [Cantha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cantha), [Elona](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elona), and the eponymous continent [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria), though it is implied they live further south than Cantha, which is where they may have originated.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-Kill_Ten_Rats-1) 

Wherever they originated, humans are not native to the world as they were brought there by the [Six Gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria).[[2\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-2) The gods themselves only predate humans by a short period of time.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-Kill_Ten_Rats-1)

Three Kingdoms for Prophecies - there are other kingdoms, <u>*should they be explored?*</u>

### Ascalon

Once a vast and prosperous nation, Ascalon now lies in ruins, its population diminished. The majority of Ascalonians live in the now ruined [Ascalon City](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascalon_City), ruled by [King Adelbern](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/King_Adelbern) during the Prophecies campaign and Eye of the North expansion. At some point between the expansion and Guild Wars 2, Ascalon will finally be lost to the Charr, when Ascalon City falls and the Charr move into Ascalon permanently. What's left of the Ascalonians will be forced back to the [Ebonhawke](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ebonhawke) fortress and Kryta. 

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascalon

### Kryta

Kryta is a land split into two during its [civil war](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Krytan_civil_war). Ever since the Charr invasion, the White Mantle have ruled over Kryta, and leave those who do not worship their Unseen gods poor and vulnerable. Their faith was founded by Saul D'Alessio and on the summer solstice they hold the annual [Test of the Chosen](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Test_of_the_Chosen) to find new recruits among the commoners, leaving farmers with fewer hands to tend the fields. 

On the other side, however, resides the [Shining Blade](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shining_Blade) - a group of rebels who seek to overthrow the White Mantle and bring equality and peace back to Kryta. Ever since 1072 AE, the Shining Blade has rallied behind the [daughter](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Princess_Salma) of the [previous king](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/King_Jadon) who fled from the throne during the Charr invasion. 

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kryta

### Orr

The sunken kingdom of Orr once held the home of the Human Gods in its capital city, Arah. Known for its highly devout populous, spires and marbled roads, the people of Orr prided themselves for their maintenance of the City of the Gods. In 1071 AE, this ended in the event known as the Cataclysm when the Charr assaulted the three human kingdoms of Tyria.

## Seer

The Seers are an ancient powerful and still mysterious race of genderless floating beings.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Seer#cite_note-1) Not much is known about them still, though their race already had a functional society and civilization by the time the [gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria) brought [humanity](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human) to [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)). Their race dates back to the writing of the [Tome of Rubicon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tome_of_Rubicon), during which they were in a war with the [Mursaat](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mursaat). At some point in time, they had found a defense against the Mursaat's [agonizing touch](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spectral_Agony) but were still defeated. 

The war itself did not annihilate the race, but rather their race was reduced over time after the war. The remains of their civilization can be seen today, though those who find it do not know what they are.[[2\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Seer#cite_note-2)

## Tengu

Tengu *are a unique* [species](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Species) *of avian humanoids found in both* [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) *and* [Cantha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cantha)*. Females are generally larger than males of the species, though their plumage is plainer, even drab. Tengu lost the ability of flight some time in the distant past, but can use their almost human hands to wield all manner of weapons—when they want to. Their talons make most weapons superfluous. Tengu hate cooked food, and most live on a diet of fresh, raw meat.*

Divided into Tribes

### Avicara

The Avicara are a tribe of white-feathered [tengu](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tengu) that live in the [Shiverpeak Mountains](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains). The Avicara are seen in the most numbers around [Mineral Springs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mineral_Springs).

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Avicara

### Caromi

The Caromi are a tribe of [tengu](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tengu) that live in [Kryta](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kryta). They are aggressive to [humans](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Humans) and [wildlife](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kryta_wildlife) and often raid traveling [merchants](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Merchant).
