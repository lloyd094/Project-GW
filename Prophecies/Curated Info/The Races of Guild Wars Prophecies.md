# The Races of Guild Wars Prophecies

This document is to list the potentially playable races in the Guild Wars Prophecies campaign. While other races exist, they are not in the story of Prophcies or in Tyria, and will thus be saved until later to prevent the scope of the project from over expanding.

[TOC]

## In General

In the MMO, GW1 only allowed the player to have characters of the Human race, either due to design to allow simplicity and focus on other areas of the game, or because of how broad the scope could easily become to correctly add other races. As a TTRPG, players have significant amounts of freedom with gameplay choices, and limiting them to one single race would be very limiting. While the choice of non-human races to play will require a little more imagination of the player to explain how/why they are there, it is not impossible and will bring in many different ways to experience the story and world of Guild Wars.

## Notes

- While both Asura and Norn exist, they do not show up until the EOTN expansion - thus they will not be considered, though they could be playable.
- Both the Forgotten and the Mursaat are ignored as playable races because the populations are so small and/or not congruent with playable races.

### Harathi (?)

(Borrowed from GW2)

Harathi are one of the [centaur](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Centaur) tribes who have entered an alliance with the [Modniir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Modniir) of the [Shiverpeak Mountains](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains). The Harathi are the largest of the three tribes in the alliance, and thus make up the bulk of their army. They're highly organized and are the engineers and scholars of the alliance, being the force behind the centaurs various siege weaponry. Despite this, they, like the [Tamini](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tamini) were forced into the alliance with the Modniir out of fear of their leader, [Ulgoth the Mighty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_Modniir_Ulgoth). 

The Harathi were, in the past, dwellers of the northern [Maguuma Jungle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Maguuma_Jungle).

### Losaru

The Losaru pride are equine [Centaurs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Centaur) that thrive throughout the [Crystal Desert](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert) and look like their relatives in [Elona](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elona). Like other centaur prides, they are dangerous and similar to the [Veldrunner](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Veldrunner). Some Losaru, specifically the [Orshad Raiders](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Orshad_Raiders), are known to eat human flesh.

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Losaru

### Modniir (?)

The Modniir is a pride of [Centaurs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Centaur) that live in regions of the [Shiverpeak Mountains](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains), such as [Drakkar Lake](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Drakkar_Lake), [Norrhart Domains](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Norrhart_Domains) and [Varajar Fells](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Varajar_Fells). Modniir usually are seen hunting in small groups, usually consisting of three or four Modniirs, but can occasionally be seen in large groups.

- Perhaps look at Minotaur, Bugbear, <u>Half-orc</u>, and <u>Tabaxi</u>

### Ash Legion

The Ash Legion is one of the four [High Legions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Legion) of the [charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr). The Ash Legion is famed for its [stalkers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr_Stalker) and [Assassins](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Assassin). Known members of its primus [warband](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Warband) include [Ghast Ashpyre](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ghast_Ashpyre) and [Rox Ashreign](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Rox_Ashreign). It is not known whether [War Ashenskull](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/War_Ashenskull) belonged to the Ash warband or the hypothetical Ashen warband, as charr surnames generally use the warband's name as a prefix.

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ash_Legion

### Blood Legion

The Blood Legion is one of the four [High Legions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Legions) of the [Charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr). The Blood Legion is famed for its members' fierceness and proficiency in melee combat. Known members of its primus [warband](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Warband) include [Blaze Bloodbane](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blaze_Bloodbane), [Kaargoth Bloodclaw](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kaargoth_Bloodclaw), [Torg Bloodspine](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Torg_Bloodspine) and [Garfazz Bloodfang](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Garfazz_Bloodfang).

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blood_Legion

### Flame Legion

The Flame Legion is one of the four [High Legions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Legions) of the [Charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr). The Flame Legion is renowned for its members' magical prowess and is most commonly associated with the [Shaman caste](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shaman_caste). Known members of its primus warband include [Chaelse Flameshielder](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Chaelse_Flameshielder), [Tenagg Flametroller](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tenagg_Flametroller) and [Tyndir Flamecaller](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyndir_Flamecaller). 

The [Burnt Warband](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Burnt_Warband) is one of the most prominent warbands in the Flame Legion. This is due to the Burnt Warband being the group of charr which found their gods, the [Titans](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Titan), at [Hrangmer](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hrangmer) 200 years before [the Searing](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Searing). When the Burnt Warband brought back the knowledge of their "new gods," the Flame Legion quickly took control over the other High Legions through the Shamans of the other three High Legions. 

The Flame Legion was the main reason why the Charr were able to cast the ritual of the Searing and attack [Ascalon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascalon), [Kryta](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kryta), and [Orr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Orr) simultaneously. It wasn't until the fall of [Hierophant Burntsoul](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hierophant_Burntsoul) that the Flame Legion started to lose its grip on the rest of the Charr. Because of the events brought forth by the Flame Legion and the Shaman caste, the Flame Legion were considered the most powerful Charr legion and has been the closest to subjugating the other legions since the fall of the [Khan-Ur](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Khan-Ur). 

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Flame_Legion

### Iron Legion

The Iron Legion is one of the four [High Legions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Legions) of the [Charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr). The Iron Legion is known for its [Siege Devourers](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Siege_Devourer), catapults, towers, and other mechanical works. No members of its primus [warband](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Warband) are known to have been encountered as of yet.

Charr
The charr are a large race of feline humanoids. They stand taller than humans but are still shorter than your average norn. Many stand hunched forward, though they are capable of standing fully upright. Their bodies are coated in fur, and their hands, while usable for wielding weapons also brandish claws and can be used for running on all fours. Their face is like that of a predatory cat with a long muzzle full of sharp teeth, the big difference being that they do grow horns, and have two separate pairs of ears on their head. Male and female charr differ slightly in their physical appearance, with females being slightly more slender and agile in their body type.

As a race, the charr are very militant. Starting at a young age, their cubs are given over to their legion to be raised up in Fahrar, which is their version of school. Here they create their first warband and learn their place in the High Legions. There are four legions which rule the charr, each focused on their own arena of war, to push the charr to maintain dominance over all of the other races, especially their hated enemy, the humans.

## Dredge

On the northern continent of [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria), the mole-people known as the Dredge are a pitiable race, enslaved by the wicked [Stone Summit](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Stone_Summit) [dwarves](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dwarf) and ready to fight alongside any who will help free them from their masters’ whips. In the [Echovald Forest](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Echovald_Forest) of [Cantha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cantha), a few small colonies of escaped Dredge jealously defend their prized freedom. The offspring of a few desperate escapees from the [Shiverpeaks](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains) who tunneled for hundreds of miles to reach their strange new home, these Dredge have no reason to feel any friendship toward humans or anyone else—they escaped slavery on their own, and plan to establish their race anew in the petrified woodlands. 

Dredge villages are marked by large dirt mounds. The mole-people live primarily in the tunnel networks linking the mounds together. Those who underestimate the ferocity and aggressiveness of the Canthan Dredge do so at their peril.

## Dwarf

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dwarf

Two Factions:

### Deldrimor

Deldrimor is a kingdom of Dwarves residing in the Shiverpeak Mountains that are ruled by a king. They are very friendly towards other races and passage through the harsh mountain range is welcome to anyone who is a friend of Deldrimor or an enemy to the Stone Summit. They hold a capital in [Thunderhead Keep](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Thunderhead_Keep_(outpost)).

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Deldrimor

### Stone Summit

The Stone Summit is a xenophobic faction which has recently broke away from the Deldrimor dwarves while being led by Dagnar Stonepate. They have had some recent successes in seizing power and resources from the Deldrimor Dwarves, most notably in claiming the vast mine of Sorrow's Furnace, which became their main base.

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Stone_Summit

Dwarves
The dwarves are one of the oldest races of Tyria, having a history that goes back long before humans ever stepped foot on Tyria. They are a short, stout race of bearded humanoids that live throughout the Shiverpeak Mountains, building halls deep beneath and above. Among the dwarves can be found some of the best blacksmith's, artisans, and miners. They have many tools and machines that assist with these tasks, including kegs of black powder. Many dwarves worship the Great Dwarf as their creator and believe that upon death they will find their way to the Great Forge. Some dwarves are also known to revere the human gods also, specifically Dwayna and Grenth on Wintersday.

A great divide grew between the dwarves when the Great Destroyer arose and their King, Jalis Ironhammer, enacted a ritual that converted the dwarves in his present company into Stone Dwarves. This, then, created a longing within the dwarves for them to undergo the rite themselves and join their brethren, but many still hold off.

Ability Score: +1 Constitution
Average Height: 4’ 3” - 4’ 9”
Average Weight: 160 - 220 lb
Age: Less than 100 Years
Size: Medium
Speed: 25’, Even when encumbered
Vision: Darkvision (60’)
Languages: Dwarven & New Krytan
Dwarven Combat Training: You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.
Subraces: Deldrimor Dwarves and Stone Dwarves.

Deldrimor Dwarves
The Deldrimor dwarves are those left who have not undergone the Rite. Because of the Rite, much of the civilization that they have created has started falling into disuse and disrepair, but the dwarves are a strong and hearty race and most plan to hold out as long as possible.

Ability Score: +1 Wisdom
Tool Proficiency: You gain proficiency with one of the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.
Dwarven Armor Training: You have proficiency with light and medium armor.
Stonecunning: Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

Stone Dwarves
The stone dwarves are vastly different from their brethren. Physically they exist and living stone, making them a strong and resilient race, but their minds are not entirely their own. The Stone Dwarves are all connected together with a sort of hive mind that, while allowing for individuality, drives them towards destroying the minions of the Elder Dragons, wherever they find them.

Ability Score: +1 Strength
Age: Immortal until body destroyed or parts detached from head.
Dragon Fury: After becoming Stone, the stone dwarf hive mind drives stone dwarves to fight the minions of creatures they have recently grown to call Elder Dragons. If such a creature is encountered, you must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become forced to combat these minions until they are dead. At the end of each turn you may retake this saving throw to shrug off the effect, if so you will be immune for the remainder of this encounter.
Stone Resistance: As a being of stone, you are immune to disease. You also do not have to eat, sleep, drink, or breathe. Magic cannot force you to sleep and you cannot be exhausted from a lack of rest.
Sentry’s Rest: While you do not need to sleep, you do need to spend 6 hours in an inert state to gain the effects of a Long Rest. During this time, you remain conscious of your surroundings.
Stone Form: Being a creature of stone, your body has a base AC of 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor. You gain resistance to non-magical pierce and slash.

## Human

Humans are one of the most widespread and influential [species](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Species) in the world of [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)). They are spread throughout the world of Tyria, including [Cantha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cantha), [Elona](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elona), and the eponymous continent [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria), though it is implied they live further south than Cantha, which is where they may have originated.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-Kill_Ten_Rats-1) 

Wherever they originated, humans are not native to the world as they were brought there by the [Six Gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria).[[2\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-2) The gods themselves only predate humans by a short period of time.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human#cite_note-Kill_Ten_Rats-1)

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human

Three Kingdoms for Prophecies - there are other kingdoms, <u>*should they be explored?*</u>

### Ascalon

Once a vast and prosperous nation, Ascalon now lies in ruins, its population diminished. The majority of Ascalonians live in the now ruined [Ascalon City](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascalon_City), ruled by [King Adelbern](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/King_Adelbern) during the Prophecies campaign and Eye of the North expansion. At some point between the expansion and Guild Wars 2, Ascalon will finally be lost to the Charr, when Ascalon City falls and the Charr move into Ascalon permanently. What's left of the Ascalonians will be forced back to the [Ebonhawke](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ebonhawke) fortress and Kryta. 

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ascalon

### Kryta

Kryta is a land split into two during its [civil war](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Krytan_civil_war). Ever since the Charr invasion, the White Mantle have ruled over Kryta, and leave those who do not worship their Unseen gods poor and vulnerable. Their faith was founded by Saul D'Alessio and on the summer solstice they hold the annual [Test of the Chosen](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Test_of_the_Chosen) to find new recruits among the commoners, leaving farmers with fewer hands to tend the fields. 

On the other side, however, resides the [Shining Blade](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shining_Blade) - a group of rebels who seek to overthrow the White Mantle and bring equality and peace back to Kryta. Ever since 1072 AE, the Shining Blade has rallied behind the [daughter](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Princess_Salma) of the [previous king](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/King_Jadon) who fled from the throne during the Charr invasion. 

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kryta

### Orr

The sunken kingdom of Orr once held the home of the Human Gods in its capital city, Arah. Known for its highly devout populous, spires and marbled roads, the people of Orr prided themselves for their maintenance of the City of the Gods. In 1071 AE, this ended in the event known as the Cataclysm when the Charr assaulted the three human kingdoms of Tyria.

Humans
Humanity is possibly one of the most widespread and active races around, aside from perhaps the Charr. Human kingdoms include Kryta, Ascalon, Vabbi, Istan, Kourna, and Cantha, spread across 3 continents and multiple islands in between. This has lead to many rivalries including the tengu and charr, but they also have many friends to be found in the dwarves and asura. The biggest defining factor about humanity is that they were brought to this world by the Six, a group of gods that molded and shaped Tyria to their liking. Because of this, they consider themselves blessed by the gods, giving them a greater intuitive understanding of magic than most other races.

## Seer

The Seers are an ancient powerful and still mysterious race of genderless floating beings.[[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Seer#cite_note-1) Not much is known about them still, though their race already had a functional society and civilization by the time the [gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gods_of_Tyria) brought [humanity](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human) to [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)). Their race dates back to the writing of the [Tome of Rubicon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tome_of_Rubicon), during which they were in a war with the [Mursaat](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mursaat). At some point in time, they had found a defense against the Mursaat's [agonizing touch](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spectral_Agony) but were still defeated. 

The war itself did not annihilate the race, but rather their race was reduced over time after the war. The remains of their civilization can be seen today, though those who find it do not know what they are.[[2\]](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Seer#cite_note-2)

## Tengu

Tengu *are a unique* [species](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Species) *of avian humanoids found in both* [Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tyria) *and* [Cantha](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cantha)*. Females are generally larger than males of the species, though their plumage is plainer, even drab. Tengu lost the ability of flight some time in the distant past, but can use their almost human hands to wield all manner of weapons—when they want to. Their talons make most weapons superfluous. Tengu hate cooked food, and most live on a diet of fresh, raw meat.*

https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tengu_(5e_Race)

https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tengu_(3.5e_Race)

Divided into Tribes

### Avicara

The Avicara are a tribe of white-feathered [tengu](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tengu) that live in the [Shiverpeak Mountains](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains). The Avicara are seen in the most numbers around [Mineral Springs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mineral_Springs).

https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Avicara

### Caromi

The Caromi are a tribe of [tengu](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tengu) that live in [Kryta](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kryta). They are aggressive to [humans](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Humans) and [wildlife](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kryta_wildlife) and often raid traveling [merchants](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Merchant).

Tengu
Tengu are an avian humanoid race that most generally are found on the Tyrian and Canthan continents. They stand taller than a human but still shorter than a charr. Their form is slightly hunched, but they are slim for their size. Tengu lost the capability to fly in their distant past, but they have gained taloned hands which can wield weapons. Their bodies are covered in feathers and on their face rests a large beak through which they can speak like any other race.

As a people, they have been pushed further and further to the extremes of society. They have held wars against both humans and dwarves to maintain some land from which to live, but such has been a losing fight. Because of this there has grown a seed of distrust for and from all other races.

Ability Score: +1 Dexterity
Average Height: 6’ 2” - 6’ 8”
Average Weight: 180 - 220 lb
Age: Less than 100 Years
Size: Medium
Speed: 30’

Languages: New Krytan & +1 language of your choice from Dwarven, Canthan, Druidic, and Old Krytan.
Talons: You are proficient with your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.
Subraces: Tyrian & Canthan

Tyrian
Within the continent of Tyria, the tengu have been pushed to extremes, mostly outside of the spheres of what people would call civilization. Quetzal tengu can be found in the deep jungles of the Maguuma and the vast forests of the Verdant Cascades. The Avicara are spread thin through the less civilized portions of the Shiverpeaks, and the Carmoni can be found similarly in Kryta. These tengu tend to have a better understanding of the natural world than the urban world.

Ability Score: +1 Wisdom, Proficiency in Survival
Mask of the Wild: You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.
Fleet of Foot: Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

Canthan
In Cantha, the wars between the tengu and the humans was fierce, almost as fierce as the hate between humans and charr. But a noble man named Togo, and his brother, the Canthan Emperor, worked hard to herald a peace between human and tengu. This peace is definitely not without its flaws, most tengu living within slums, but because of this many Canthan tengu have grown up with a better understanding of trade and society.

Ability Score: +1 Charisma, Proficiency in one skill from Persuasion, Intimidate, or Deception
Extra Language: Living in an Urban Environment, you have learned to speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.
Trader's Intuition: Whenever you make a Charisma (Insight) check related to the buying or selling of products, you are considered proficient in the Insight skill, and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal bonus.
