# The Races of Guild Wars Prophecies

This document is to list the potentially playable races in the Guild Wars Prophecies campaign. While other races exist, they are not in the story of Prophcies or in Tyria, and will thus be saved until later to prevent the scope of the project from over expanding.

## In General

In the MMO, GW1 only allowed the player to have characters of the Human race, either due to design to allow simplicity and focus on other areas of the game, or because of how broad the scope could easily become to correctly add other races. As a TTRPG, players have significant amounts of freedom with gameplay choices, and limiting them to one single race would be very limiting. While the choice of non-human races to play will require a little more imagination of the player to explain how/why they are there, it is not impossible and will bring in many different ways to experience the story and world of Guild Wars.
