Hey there, and welcome to Project GW - the project that aims to bring the wonderful world of Guild Wars to the tabletop community starting with D&D5e. 

This site is what will be used to give "blog updates" to the project to let you all know what's going on at the time. No, it will not be constantly updated. But I will try to keep it updated whenever anything important comes up.

If you are interested in the project or want to help out in any way, check out the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/lloyd094/Project-GW)!
